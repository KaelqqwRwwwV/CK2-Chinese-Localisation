EVTTITLEHF9;A Prophecy Foretold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF9;After trudging through the thick forest the whole day and evening I reach a moonlit glade late in the night. At the end of the glade there's a small pond shining in silver. Next to the pond lies a lustrous body suspended in time. Except for the small and steady stream of blood that's still seeping out from a cut under the belly, the grandiose being of a unicorn could have just as well been sleeping from eternity and beyond - a mesmerizing sight. Without any option to re-animate this wonder of nature I'm left with a difficult choice of what to do since the carcass is too heavy to bring home as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Though [From.GetSheHe] has left the Varangian Guard, my [From.GetSonDaughter] has apparently found [From.GetHerselfHimself] a Greek [From.GetHusbandWifeOpp] and decided to remain in Miklagård and build a new life there. "It is doubtful we will ever see [From.GetHerHim] again, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3112;My [From.GetBoyGirl]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3113;After finishing [From.GetHerHis] service with the Varangian Guard, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has married a local [From.GetManWomanOpp] and decided to remain in Constantinople instead of returning home to the barbaric frozen wasteland [From.GetSheHe] once came from. [From.GetSheHeCap] has pledged [From.GetHerHis] continued service to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3115;A heavily scarred warrior clad in strange armor approaches my throne, and before [From.GetSheHe] can be disarmed, the stranger relieves my guard of their spear in a swift, fluid motion and tosses it aside. Other guards hurry forward, but I raise my hand to stop them. The stranger is [From.GetTitledFirstName], at last returned from Greece!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3117;My [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has finally returned home from Greece and [From.GetHerHis] service with the Varangian Guard! Although I can't quite put my finger on it, [From.GetSheHe] seems different somehow... and what is this Greek love he speaks of?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3117;No matter, I'm just glad [From.GetSheHe] made it home!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3119;A frail, robed [From.GetManWoman] is led into my throne room, and the guards explain that [From.GetSheHe] just arrived on a ship coming from Miklagård. The [From.GetManWoman] would only speak my name over and over again, and so [From.GetSheHe] was brought to me. To my horror, I recognize [From.GetHerHim] at last as [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3121;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally returned home after a long and successful career in the Varangian Guard! [From.GetSheHeCap] fought in several battles, and learned much from the clever strategies and tactics favored by both the Greeks and their enemies in Serkland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3123;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Greece and the Varangian Guard, but [From.GetSheHe] refuses to speak of [From.GetHerHis] experiences there. I know [From.GetSheHe] took part in several battles and killed many foes, but instead of reveling in the glory of [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments, [From.GetFirstName] is plagued by nightmares and jumps at sudden sounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3125;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from Miklagård and [From.GetHerHis] service with the Varangian Guard, but [From.GetSheHe] is not alone. [From.GetSheHeCap] has found a Greek [From.GetHusbandWifeOpp] and brought [From.GetHerHimOpp] with [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCapOpp] is not familiar with our customs or language, and the climate does not seem to agree with [From.GetHerHimOpp], but [From.GetSheHeOpp] seems willing to make the best of [From.GetHerHisOpp] new home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3129;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Miklagård and the Varangian Guard a changed [From.GetManWoman]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is wiser, more confident in [From.GetHerHis] own abilities and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent in Greece did [From.GetHerHim] good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3131;Several former Varangian Guardsmen have recently returned home after serving the Greek [greek_king_or_queen.GetKingQueen], and they bring news most grave. My [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has fallen in battle while campaigning in Serkland. They assure me that [From.GetSheHe] faced [From.GetHerHis] enemy with bravery and slew many, before their numbers overwhelmed [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3131;My [From.GetSonDaughter] died a hero...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3133;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from Greece on a longship filled with the spoils of war! Apparently the great [greek_king_or_queen.GetKingQueen] of the Greeks is generous to those who serve [greek_king_or_queen.GetHerHim] well, and there is gold here from all over the Greek realm, Serkland and beyond. My [From.GetSonDaughter] insists on sharing these riches with me, [From.GetHerHis] loving [Root.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3134;The death of my [From.GetRootRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has urged me to depart Miklagård and leave the Varangian guard. I am returning home on a longship, filled with loot from our campaigns in Serkland. After a long and perilous journey back, my feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is my birthright. The throne is mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3127;After many years in Greece, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from [From.GetHerHis] service to the Varangian Guard and returned home. My son is a changed [From.GetManWoman], however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and [From.GetSheHe] instead speaks incessantly of Christendom and the horrors that await those who refuse to convert...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_A;As I charge into the glade, I jump over the beast, now laying still on the ground. My opponent yelps, clearly worn out from [other_combatant.GetHerHis] previous fight. "Need to catch your breath, huh?" I snicker, hefting my [Root.GetDuelWeapon]. Then I hear an angry growl behind me. I turn, finding myself face to face with a furious [target_ruler.Capital.GetRegionalBigAnimal]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_12006;My history in battle is known to many, but there are still those who could benefit from learning more about my experiences. "Like that time you chopped someone's head off?" [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] asks, in response to my idea. "A feast, where you regale your court with the stories!" [fellow_member.GetSheHe] continues. I consider the spirits it could lift, as I soon depart for [target_title.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
