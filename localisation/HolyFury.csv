EVTDESC_HFP_10101_clumsy;武器已经举起，我向[combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName]发起了冲锋，但是被什么东西绊倒了。我在对手面前就这样摔倒了，他一脸难以置信的看着我，因为我竟然自己凑到[combatant_2.GetHerHis]武器上去。我现在已经无计可施，所以用双手紧紧缠住[combatant_2.GetManWoman]的脖子，[combatant_2.GetHerHis]眼睛里瞬间被恐惧填满。;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE20003;The Conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20003;You meet with your vassals and [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s Imams in the middle of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]'s square.\nAddressing the crowd of commoners gathered all around you, you publicly denounce the old gods and spit on their false idols, gesturing for your vassals to do the same. A few complaints rise from the crowd, but they are swiftly quelled. Then, as the Imams set fire to the icons, you declare your faith to Allah and to His Prophet.\nYou all turn your back to the pyre of false gods and bow to Mecca.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20003;The hooded priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] arrive at dawn, but the ceremony begins only after sunset, once they have helped the icons of the new gods adjust to their new home in your temple.\nYou meet with your vassals outside the city, a crowd of your subjects assembling all around you, and then, under the grim echoes of drums and horns, the Germanic priests begin the rite. They paint your faces with the blood of the sacrificial lambs, burn sacred herbs and chant their secret spells, as you all enter a trance.\nVisions of horror and delight accompany you for the rest of the night. When you wake at dawn of the next day, the priests are already gone. Little by little, the confused crowd of converts returns to [converting_king.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFD20003;Following the instructions of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, you assemble your vassals and ride out of [converting_king.Capital.GetName] on your best horse.\nThe Tengri priests lead you away from the civilized roads, deep into the wilderness, refusing to answer to any query about your destination.\nAfter riding for the entire day, you stop at the edge of a cliff, looking at the bleeding hues of the sunset. The priests burn a few offerings of food to the sky god, creating a large line of dark smoke from a small set of fires. Then, as their chants echo through the air, you ride with your vassals through the smoke and cleanse yourself of the old gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFE20003;The priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] insist that the ritual be performed at sunset. When the time comes you meet your vassals at the top of a cliff outside [converting_king.Capital.GetName], with a crowd of your subjects waiting below. \nThe priests start the ceremony chanting and playing their sacred instruments. When the last rays of sun disappear in the distance you and your vassals proclaim that your old gods are dying with this day. The priests resume their singing and dancing, enduring for the entirety of the night, even after most of the common crowd has fallen asleep. When dawn comes, they proclaim that you are reborn with the new day under the protection of Dievas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

When the last rays of sun disappear in the distance you and your vassals proclaim that your old gods are dying with this day. The priests resume their singing and dancing, enduring for the entirety of the night, even after most of the common crowd has fallen asleep. When dawn comes and the pillar of smoke finally vanishes, they proclaim that the sky god has accepted your offering and welcomes you under his protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFG20003;The priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] insist that the ritual be performed at sunset. When the time comes you meet your vassals at the top of a cliff outside [converting_king.Capital.GetName], with a crowd of your subjects waiting below. \nThe priests start the ceremony beating their drums to gain the favor of the thunder god. When the last rays of sun disappear in the distance you and your vassals proclaim that your old gods are dying with this day. The priests resume their singing and dancing, enduring for the entirety of the night, even after most of the common crowd has fallen asleep. When dawn comes, they proclaim that you are reborn with the new day under the protection of Perun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFH20003;Following the instructions of the Aztec priests, you round up a group of convicted criminals and have them dragged in the middle of [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName]'s square, where a crowd has already rallied.\nThere, the priests dress them up with blind masks depicting your old gods and adorn you and your vassals with the garments of the new ones.\nThe confused and scared criminals are then set free, and in a ritualistic skirmish, you and your vassals slaughter them in front of your subjects, bathing in their blood and proclaiming your allegiance to the gods of the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFI20003;The shamans from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] arrive in a long procession, carrying an endless parade of idols.\nYou meet them alongside your vassals in the middle of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]'s main square, where you publicly renounce the old gods and welcome the new ones into your realm. One by one, you bow and kiss the feet of the new totems as they are carried inside your temple, while the priests interpret the gods' reactions to your welcome and placate any angry spirits of the old faith with loud drumming.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFL20003;The [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests arrive at [converting_king.Capital.GetName] with a luxurious parade, carrying the tall, shining statue of the sun god to the center of your capital. \nYou meet them with your vassals, surrounded by a crowd of commoners, and publicly renounce your old gods before bowing to the golden idol. \nOne by one, you order your offerings of gold and precious stones to be delivered unto the new god, covering his statue little by little with increasingly more opulent garments. After you and your vassals have finished with your donations, some of the people from the crowd join in as well, leaving what little they have at the feet of the idol as it is carried inside its new home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFM20003;The Hellenic priests arrive to [converting_king.Capital.GetName] a few days before the ceremony in order to settle the statues of the new gods in their new home.\nThe evening before the conversion, you and your vassals are summoned in the temple's garden, where the priests strip you naked and have your entire bodies shaved and washed. The morning after, you meet the priests outside the temple with a large crowd at your back, and watch them sacrifice a dozen bulls to the main gods in front of the doors of the temple. The priests then carry the remains of their offerings inside, and, after a long hour, they finally re-emerge from their sanctum to address the confused crowd and proclaim that the gods have accepted your offering and will take further donations into consideration in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFN20003;The [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests arrive a few days before the ceremony in order to settle in their new temple.\nFor all the remaining days before the event, you and your vassals find yourself stuck listening to an endless list of rules and rituals that the priests swear you must absolutely know in order to correctly worship [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetHighGodName]. When the day for the mass conversion comes, the ceremony itself looks almost like an afterthought in comparison to the bureaucratic preparation. The priests quickly cleanse all old icons publicly and allow you to renounce your old gods before hiding back inside the temple and resuming their private rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFO20003;The [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] rabbis arrive to [converting_king.Capital.GetName] on a clear morning. \nYou meet with them alongside your vassals and at the head of a large crowd in the middle of the main square. Three tall pedestals have been set up for the newcomers, following their instructions, and the three assigned judges amongst them take place atop them. You are the first to be called to the public beth din, and for what feels like an eternity, the three judges examine the sincerity of your conversion. After they are finished with you, they move onto your vassals, testing them one by one as the crowd watches in silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20003;Strangely enough, the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests arrive at your capital without much pomp.\nThey ask you to remain in seclusion with them for the remaining days before the conversions, they respectfully remove the icons of the old gods from your temple, and instruct you about your new responsibilities as a [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName]. When the day of the great ceremony comes, you meet with your vassals outside [converting_king.Capital.GetName], surrounded by a crowd of commoners. There, you strip yourselves of all your regalia, and sit around a sacred fire to meditate in silence, with the priests' soft chanting echoing in the background.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20003;This is a new beginning for our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE20004;The Conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20004;You receive news from your missionaries only a few days after the mass baptism of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]. Although the priest writes that he does not feel entirely convinced about the sincerity of the barbarians' conversion, the ceremony went well and [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is now officially [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName].\nBy aiding in the conversion of an entire score of pagans to the One True Faith, you have accomplished a feat worthy of the Apostles themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20004;Although the Prophet often spread His Word by the sword, it is a commendable feat for you to have converted an entire score of pagans through words only. \nYou have no doubts that infidels still hide in [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s domain, but now that the ruling class has been brought into the light, it is only a matter of time until everybody else in the realm follows. With the mass conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetTitle] to [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName], you have brought the universal rule of Islam over the world one step closer to its completion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20004;The priests you have sent to [converting_king.Capital.GetName] return home exhausted and satisfied. \nThe people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have fully embraced their new gods. Their warriors will surely make a fine addition to Odin's army in Valhalla for the final war to come. \nWith your actions you have gained another ally in the eternal fight against the bringers of the end times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFD20004;The priests sent to introduce Tengri to the strange people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have returned bringing good news. \n[converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] has sealed [converting_king.GetHerHis] allegiance with the sky god and the spirits of your ancestors and now [converting_king.GetHerHis] whole people ride under their protection. \nAs long as they will follow the rite and placate the spirits, they have opened themselves a road to a bright and prosperous future under the Great Blue Sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFE20004;Your priests have done their best to introduce [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s people to your gods and to teach them how to placate the spirits of the wild surrounding them. \nYou can only hope now that they will stay true to their word and please the gods according to tradition lest ill luck befalls them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFH20004;Your priests return with good news. \n[converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s tribes have accepted their new gods and performed their first ritual sacrifices. Their resolve is commendable and will certainly prove fundamental to keep the thirst for blood of the immortals in check. Only through daily sacrifices can the gods remain strong enough to keep the sun in the sky and let the water flow.\nWe can only hope that [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] has fully understood [converting_king.GetHerHis] important new role in postponing the apocalypse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFI20004;You are certain [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] and [converting_king.GetHerHis] vassals were quite surprised by the crowd of idols that have now taken place in their temple. \nIt will certainly beneficial for them as well as their subjects to know how to placate and pray to the spirits for blessings and curses in the proper way. \nYou can only hope that they understood all the spells correctly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFL20004;Your priests have done their best to introduce [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s people to the sun god. \nYou can only hope now that they will stay true to their word and please Zun according to tradition lest ill luck befalls them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFM20004;It is quite amusing to watch barbarians attempt to mimic civilized society. \nWhile you certainly appreciate [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s eagerness to be educated about the proper worship of the gods, you cannot deny to yourself a tinge of skepticism about their results. You very much doubt these tribal primitives will ever be able to pronounce the gods' names correctly, let alone know how to please them properly. \nThen again, their newly found faith might put a stop to their pillaging, which made your priests' work not a complete waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFN20004;Your priests have returned bringing news from [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nThe local tribes have been successfully introduced to the worship of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. \nWith the proper grooming, they will become model followers of the true faith, given enough time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFO20004;The rabbis have returned completely exhausted after the mass trial of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]. \nThanks to their tireless work and the enlightenment of [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName], another tribe has joined the sacred covenant with Yahweh and walks the Earth under His protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20004;Your priests have done what they could to introduce [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith.

EVTTITLE20008;The Conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20008;The conversion of [converting_king.Capital.GetName] starts on a cold morning.\nThe Bishop leading [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s embassy meets your liege at a river near the city. You stand beside [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName], while [converting_king.GetHerHis] subjects wait their turn behind you, looking still visibly confused.The Bishop recites a few verses from the Bible, then [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] leads you all in the river while the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests baptize you as you pass by them. It takes some prodding from the guards to convince the peasants to follow you into the water, but, after a while, the entire crowd stands soaked and shaking by the riverside, just in time to watch the priests and their helpers drop your old idols into the waves.\n"As the false visages are swallowed by the tides," the Bishop proclaims, "may their memory forever be banished from your soul.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20008;You meet with your liege and [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s Imams in the middle of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]'s square.\nAddressing the crowd of commoners reunited all around you, [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] publicly denounces the old gods and spits on their false idols, gesturing for your and the [converting_king.GetHerHis] vassals to do the same. A few complaints rise from the crowd, but they are swiftly quelled. Then, as the Imams set fire to the icons, you declare your faith to Allah and to His Prophet.\nYou all turn your back to the pyre of false gods and bow to Mecca.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20008;The hooded priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] arrive at dawn, but the ceremony begins only after sunset, after they have helped the icons of the new gods adjust to their new home in [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s temple.\nYou meet with your liege outside the city, a crowd of [converting_king.GetHerHis] subjects assembling all around you, and then, under the grim echoes of drums and horns, the Germanic priests begin the rite. They paint your faces with the blood of the sacrificial lambs, burn sacred herbs and chant their secret spells, as you all enter a trance.\nVisions of horror and delight accompany you for the rest of the night. When you wake at dawn of the next day, the priests are already gone. Little by little, the confused crowd of converts returns to [converting_king.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFD20008;Following the instructions of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] summons you and [converting_king.GetHerHis] other vassals and ride out of [converting_king.Capital.GetName] on [converting_king.GetHerHis] best horse.\nThe Tengri priests lead you away from the civilized roads, deep into the wilderness, refusing to answer to any query about your destination.\nAfter riding for the entire day, you stop at the edge of a cliff, looking at the bleeding hues of the sunset. The priests burn a few offerings of food to the sky god, creating a large line of dark smoke from a small set of fires. Then, as their chants echo through the air, you all ride through the smoke following your liege and cleanse yourself of the old gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFE20008;The priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] insist that the ritual be performed at sunset. When the time comes you meet your liege at the top of a cliff outside [converting_king.Capital.GetName], with a crowd of [converting_king.GetHerHis] subjects waiting below. \nThe priests start the ceremony chanting and playing their sacred instruments. When the last rays of sun disappear in the distance you all proclaim that your old gods are dying with this day. The priests resume their singing and dancing, enduring for the entirety of the night, even after most of the common crowd has fallen asleep. When dawn comes, they proclaim that you are reborn with the new day under the protection of Dievas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFF20008;The priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] insist that the ritual be performed at sunset. When the time comes you meet your liege at the top of a cliff outside [converting_king.Capital.GetName], with a crowd of [converting_king.GetHerHis] subjects waiting below. \nThe priests start the ceremony creating a large fire with your offerings in order to satiate the spirits. When the last rays of sun disappear in the distance you all proclaim that your old gods are dying with this day. The priests resume their singing and dancing, enduring for the entirety of the night, even after most of the common crowd has fallen asleep. When dawn comes and the pillar of smoke finally vanishes, they proclaim that the sky god has accepted your offering and welcomes you under his protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFG20008;The priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] insist that the ritual be performed at sunset. When the time comes you meet your liege at the top of a cliff outside [converting_king.Capital.GetName], with a crowd of [converting_king.GetHerHis] subjects waiting below. \nThe priests start the ceremony beating their drums to gain the favor of the thunder god. When the last rays of sun disappear in the distance you all proclaim that your old gods are dying with this day. The priests resume their singing and dancing, enduring for the entirety of the night, even after most of the common crowd has fallen asleep. When dawn comes, they proclaim that you are reborn with the new day under the protection of Perun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFH20008;Following the instructions of the Aztec priests, your liege rounds up a group of convicted criminals and has them dragged in the middle of [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName]'s square, where a crowd has already rallied.\nThere, the priests dress them up with blind masks depicting your old gods and adorn you, your liege and all [converting_king.GetHerHis] other vassals with the garments of the new ones.\nThe confused and scared criminals are then set free, and in a ritualistic skirmish, you slaughter them in front of your subjects, bathing in their blood and proclaiming your allegiance to the gods of the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFI20008;The shamans from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] arrive in a long procession, carrying an endless parade of idols.\nYou meet them alongside your liege and [converting_king.GetHerHis] other vassals in the middle of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]'s main square, where you publicly renounce the old gods and welcome the new ones in your realm. One by one, you bow and kiss the feet of the new totems as they are carried inside your temple, while the priests interpret the gods' reactions to your welcome and placate any angry spirits of the old faith with loud drumming.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFL20008;The [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests arrive at [converting_king.Capital.GetName] with a luxurious parade, carrying the tall, shining statue of the sun god to the center of [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s capital. \nYou meet them with your liege and [converting_king.GetHerHis] other vassals, surrounded by a crowd of commoners, and publicly renounce your old gods before bowing to the golden idol. \nOne by one, [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] orders your offerings of gold and precious stones to be delivered unto the new god, covering his statue little by little with increasingly more opulent garments. After you have all finished with your donations, some of the people from the crowd join in as well, leaving what little they have at the feet of the idol as it is carried inside its new home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFM20008;The Hellenic priests arrive to [converting_king.Capital.GetName] a few days before the ceremony in order to settle the statues of the new gods in their new home.\nThe evening before the conversion, you and your liege are summoned in the temple's garden, where the priests strip you naked and have your entire bodies shaved and washed. The morning after, you meet the priests outside the temple with a large crowd at your back, and watch them sacrifice a dozen bulls to the main gods in front of the doors of the temple. The priests then carry the remains of their offerings inside, and, after a long hour, they finally re-emerge from their sanctum to address the confused crowd and proclaim that the gods have accepted your offering and will take further donations in consideration in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFN20008;The [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests arrive a few days before the ceremony in order to settle in their new temple.\nFor all the remaining days before the event, you and your liege find yourself stuck listening to an endless list of rules and rituals that the priests swear you must absolutely know in order to correctly worship [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetHighGodName]. When the day for the mass conversion comes, the ceremony itself looks almost like an afterthought in comparison to the bureaucratic preparation. The priests quickly cleanse all old icons publicly and allow you to renounce your old gods before hiding back inside the temple and resuming their private rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFO20008;The [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] rabbis arrive to [converting_king.Capital.GetName] on a clear morning. \nYou meet up with them alongside your liege and at the head of a large crowd in the middle of the main square. Three tall pedestals have been set up for the newcomers, following their instructions, and the three assigned judges amongst them take place atop them. Your liege is the first to be called to the public beth din, and for what feels like an eternity, the three judges examine the sincerity of [converting_king.GetHerHis] conversion. After they are finished with [converting_king.GetHerHim], they move onto you and the other vassals, testing you one by one as the crowd watches in silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20008;Strangely enough, the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests arrive at [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] capital without much pomp.\nThey ask both your liege and all of you to remain in seclusion with them for the remaining days before the conversions, they respectfully remove the icons of the old gods from your temple, and instruct you about your new responsibilities as [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] converts. When the day of the great ceremony comes, you meet with your liege outside [converting_king.Capital.GetName], surrounded by a crowd of commoners. There, you strip yourselves of all your regalia, sit around a sacred fire and meditate in silence, with the priests' soft chanting echoing in the background.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFQ20008;[converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] and all of [converting_king.GetHerHis] spineless new converts have reunited at [converting_king.Capital.GetName] to be baptized by a [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priest. \nThe once proud people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have been led like cattle through a river while the blasphemous ceremony took place above them. \nYou can only imagine what sort of indignities the foreign priests subjected them to, but you are certain that now it is only a matter of time before the shadow of the cross reaches [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF20010;And for all this I will forever hate [converting_king.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20011;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s stubbornness in clinging to the old faith has become more than a simple nuisance. \nMany have reported [From.GetHerHim] claiming that I am a traitor to my people and that I have sold off [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName].\nThere's little doubt [From.GetFirstName] has become my enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Abandoning the old gods has made me realize how much more purpose my life can have while serving [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Everyday I am amazed by how different everything looks through my new [Root.Religion.GetName] perspective...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20039;I must embrace this newfound faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20039;But my conversion was mainly for political reasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20040;The more I think about the great conversion, the more doubt gnaws at my mind. [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests put up a nice spectacle, but even after converting your entire realm, there was no miracle, no divine revelation to reward your accomplishment. The peasants still toil in the fields, the chieftains still squabble amongst themselves. \nNothing changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20040;Why does not [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] speak to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20040;I must not waver. A sign will come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20041;Becoming a [Root.Religion.GetName] has forced me to rethink a lot of my life choices. \nMy conversion will have been for nothing if I do not strive to better serve [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and my [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20041;I should do more for my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20041;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] would not wish for a weak servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20042;Since the day of the great conversion, I have spent many hours listening to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, learning more about my newly acquired faith. \nBeing lectured day and night by all these old men of the cloth is making me realize how little I know about [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and of my new responsibilities as a [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20042;I really know nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20042;I am sure there are many things that the priests do not know either.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20043;I have had a lot of time to meditate about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] since my conversion. \nKnowing that I still have to prove myself before my new protector has filled me with a divine resolve to test my mettle against the infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20043;And test it I shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20043;How can I serve [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] if I am dead?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20044;Since the day of the great conversion, I have spent many hours listening to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, learning more about my newly acquired faith. If there is one thing that they all agree upon, it is how beneficial it would be for the salvation of my soul to regularly and generously invest more of my material gains in the newly established religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20044;Perhaps I should be more charitable...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20044;I doubt any of my possessions are worthy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20045;Since the day of the great conversion, I have spent many hours listening to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, learning more about my newly acquired faith. \nAll this time away from the excesses of the life at the [Root.GetHouse] has forced me to limit my diet to a couple of scarce meals per day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20045;I must endure it nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20045;Enough with bread and water!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20046;There is still much that I have to learn about being a [Root.Religion.GetName], but, thanks to the help of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, I feel I am every day a little closer to understanding how to properly serve [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20046;I have still much to learn about this new religion...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20047;Although the great conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was a success, my work to help [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s savage people to turn them into proper [Root.Religion.GetName] converts is not done yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20047;A new church is what they need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAHF20047;Contact §Y[converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]§! to inform [converting_king.GetHerHim] that you would like to fund the construction of a new church within [converting_king.GetHerHis] lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20047;Money is always useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBHF20047;Send money to §Y[converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]§! to help [converting_king.GetHerHim] in [converting_king.GetHerHis] efforts to convert §Y[converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20047;I shall send them more priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHF20047;Send a missionary force to §Y[converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName]§! in order to proselytize in the realm's remaining pagan provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20047;We cannot spare funds to help savages right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20048;After helping them see the light of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and their [converting_king.GetTitle] have often been in my thoughts. \nPerhaps visiting [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] could help improve the relations between our realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20048;Seems like a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAHF20048;Travel to §Y[converting_king.Capital.GetName]§! to meet §Y[converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]§! and spend some time there to know [converting_king.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20048;I have no time to mingle with savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20049;[Root.GetTitledName],\nWe have decided to help you in your holy quest to turn your subjects to the true faith by funding the construction of a new church in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20049;A new church is just what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20049;I will decide when and if a new church is needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20050;[Root.GetTitledName], \nI am glad to read of your decision. A new church is just what we needed to help spread the word of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to the masses. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20050;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20051;[Root.GetTitledName], \nI appreciate your thought, but I must refuse your proposal: maintaining a new church would be no easy task, even if its construction was covered by your generous offer. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20051;What a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20052;[Root.GetTitledName],\nIn order to assist you in the conversion of your lands to the rightful worship of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName], we have decided to send you a modest sum of gold from Our royal coffers. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20052;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20053;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\nYour generous offer was much appreciated. You can rest assured that your gold will be dutifully invested to spread the holy message of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20053;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20054;[Root.GetTitledName],\nIn an effort to assist you in the conversion of your realm, we have decided to send more of Our missionaries to your lands. They will be sure to rectify the path of the few remaining wayward subjects.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20054;Your help is much appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
baptism_new_missionaries_tooltip;Missionaries from §Y[From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]§! will be dispatched to one of your pagan provinces in order to convert it to the new faith.\nNote that their actions might upset the peasantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20054;No, I do not want foreign priests upsetting the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20057;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI was glad for the arrival of your missionaries. The sooner all of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] becomes [Root.Religion.GetName] the better for everyone.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20057;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20058;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI am afraid I have had to send your missionaries back without allowing them to fulfill their task. Tensions are still high after the great ceremony, and I do not wish to stir the peasants into open rebellion.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20058;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20059;Missionaries from [sponsoring_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have arrived at [From.GetName]. Acting with the approval of [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName], these priests have spent the last days convincing the inhabitants of the province to abandon their old faith and become proper [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20059;This is great news!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20059;More and more people are abandoning the old gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20060;Thanks to the efforts of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s missionaries, the people of [From.GetName] have abandoned their old pagan beliefs and embraced the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20060;This is great news!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20061;Missionaries from [sponsoring_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have arrived at [From.GetName]. Acting with the approval of [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName], these priests have spent the last days convincing the inhabitants of the province to abandon their old faith and become proper [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName]. \nUnfortunately, their harsh methods and lack of understanding of the customs of our lands have led them to stir up trouble with the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20061;A necessary evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20061;Foreign blasphemers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20062;Thanks to the efforts of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s missionaries, the people of [From.GetName] have finally abandoned their old pagan beliefs and embraced the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith. \nUnfortunately, their harsh methods and lack of understanding of the customs of our lands have led them to stir up trouble with the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20062;A necessary evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20063;[Root.GetTitledName],\nWe are happy to announce Our impending visit to [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. It has been some time now since your conversion to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, and we are eager to meet you in person and see your realm now that it is properly civilized.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20063;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20064;There is still some time to prepare for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s unexpected visit. This meeting presents me with a great opportunity to improve my relationship with the [FromFrom.GetTitle] of [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. I should be careful not to squander it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20064;We will have a lavish welcome feast prepared for [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20064;A welcoming parade will be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20064;We can muster only a cheap meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20064;We cannot afford anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20065;Traveling to the tribal realm of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been a reinvigorating experience for me. With only a small escort, I have left the familiar sights of my homeland to visit a more savage region of the known world, only to help spread the word of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. I cannot wait to witness the effects of the mass conversion on [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20065;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20066;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s party has finally been spotted in my provinces. Though [From.GetSheHe] knows the way to [Root.Capital.GetName], it might help to have somebody go meet up with [From.GetHerHim] and officially welcome [From.GetHerHim] to [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20066;I shall go myself, alongside [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20066;I will go meet [From.GetHerHim] myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20066;[convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName] will go meet [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20066;If [From.GetSheHe] already knows the way...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20067;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to come meet me a few days from the capital to formally and personally welcome me to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Riding alongside [From.GetHerHis] men-at-arms, there was also [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName], the [Root.Culture.GetName] priest I had sent to help [From.GetTitledFirstName] some time ago. Seeing a familiar face traveling with my host has certainly been an appreciated gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20067;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to come meet me a few days from the capital to formally and personally welcome me to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Seeing my host come meet me in person has certainly been an appreciated gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20067;I was surprised to see [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName], the [Root.Culture.GetName] priest I had sent to help [From.GetTitledFirstName] some time ago, ride to officially welcome me to [convert_lord_spiritual.GetHerHis] new liege's realm. Although seeing a familiar face is a nice surprise, I cannot deny a tinge of annoyance learning that my host has not come to welcome me in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20067;Despite having made our presence quite apparent and being now only a few days from [From.Capital.GetName], no welcoming party was sent from the capital to greet me. I am not sure if [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s rudeness is a result of ignorance or spite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20067;A satisfying welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20067;One must be patient with these savages...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20067;I expected more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20068;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was clearly pleased to have me welcome [From.GetHerHim] personally before arriving at the capital. [From.GetSheHeCap] thanked me for my kindness and talked about what an interesting travel [From.GetSheHe] has had up to this point. [From.GetSheHeCap] was also happy to see [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName] riding by my side. This visit is certainly off to a good start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF20068;Sending [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName] to meet [From.GetTitledFirstName] was not a bad idea. I just received a report from the priest telling me that his former liege was glad to be welcomed by a familiar face. This visit is certainly off to a good start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20068;Despite lacking any proper welcome party, the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] did not look particularly displeased when [From.GetSheHe] finally reached the gates of [Root.Capital.GetName], at least according to the reports I received from my courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20068;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20069;Despite meeting [From.GetHerHim] with all the pomp a [From.GetTitle] deserves, [From.GetTitledFirstName] looked quite displeased after our first encounter. Perhaps something bad has happened during [From.GetHerHis] travel to put [From.GetHerHim] in such a bad mood. Hopefully I will have more chances to make up for the less than ideal start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF20069;According to my courtiers' reports, [From.GetTitledFirstName] looked quite displeased to not see me ride out to welcome [From.GetHerHim] officially. Hopefully I will have other chances to make up for the less than ideal start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20069;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20070;After my arrival at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s palace, I was pleased to see that my host had prepared a magnificent feast in my honor, providing me and my men with all sorts of food and entertainment. For the rest of the night after our arrival, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] Chieftains delighted us with the history of their tribes and their legendary ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20070;My arrival at [From.Capital.GetName] was graced by sumptuous parade organized by [From.GetTitledFirstName] in my honor. Watching the lines of warriors and chieftains chanting and marching through the street to lead me to my host's palace was quite the spectacle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20070;I was not happy to discover that my host had only organized a small banquet in honor of my arrival. While I appreciated eating at least some decent food after the long travel, it hardly felt like a feast fit for a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20070;I was not happy to discover that my host had not prepared anything for my arrival at [From.Capital.GetName]. Especially after the long travel, I was hoping to have at least some decent food, rather than be shown immediately to my chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20070;Not bad. Not bad at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20070;I suppose it is passable at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20070;A warm bed is all I need right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20070;This is not what I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20071;Looks like my efforts to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName] with a lavish feast were not in vain: my guest looked very satisfied of the food and entertainment I provided for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20071;Looks like my efforts to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName] with a great parade in [From.GetHerHis] honor were not in vain: my guest looked very satisfied of the spectacle I provided for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20071;Despite my lack of preparation, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look too upset to see that I had only prepared a meager feast for [From.GetHerHis] arrival. Perhaps, after the hardships of the travel, [From.GetSheHe] was just happy to finally sleep under a roof.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20071;Despite my lack of preparation, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look too upset to see that I had nothing prepared for [From.GetHerHis] arrival. Perhaps, after the hardships of the travel, [From.GetSheHe] was just happy to finally sleep under a roof.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20071;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20072;Despite my best efforts, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look pleased by the feast I had prepared for [From.GetHerHim]. After eating only a little, [From.GetSheHe] excused [From.GetHerselfHimself] and retired to [From.GetHerHis] assigned chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20072;Despite my best efforts, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look pleased by the parade I had prepared for [From.GetHerHim]. After watching the spectacle only for a while, [From.GetSheHe] excused [From.GetHerselfHimself] and retired to [From.GetHerHis] assigned chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20072;Unfortunately, it appears that my lack of effort in the preparation for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s welcoming feast did not go unnoticed. The [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] looked clearly upset to be presented with little food and no entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20072;Predictably, the complete lack of preparation for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s arrival did not go unnoticed. The [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was quite upset to discover no feast nor celebration had been organized for [From.GetHerHis] arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20072;What was [From.GetSheHe] expecting?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20073;Having [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] in my court for a few days presents me with a great opportunity to strengthen the relationship between our realms. If I could convince [FromFrom.GetHerHim] that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is a civilized and respectable realm, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] might decide that it is in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] best interests to strengthen our alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20073;I will talk to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] about our laws and customs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20073;I will talk to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] about our military strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20073;I will convince [FromFrom.GetHerHim] that our realms are not so different.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20073;I will show [FromFrom.GetHerHim] how much we learned about the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20074;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am more and more surprised by the complexity of the laws and customs of the locals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has revealed [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a distinguished and civilized ruler, very unlike the primitive chieftain I initially thought [From.GetHerHim] to be. It is clear to me now that helping [From.GetHerHim] to convert [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was not a wasted effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20074;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am more and more surprised by strength and complex hierarchy of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s army.

EVTOPTAHF20074;Very impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20075;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am becoming more and more convinced that the people of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] must have converted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith in name only.

EVTDESCDHA20076;Thanks to my continuous efforts, I seem to have convinced [From.GetTitledFirstName] that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is a respectable and powerful realm, one that no [From.Religion.GetName] [From.GetTitle] would be ashamed to call an ally.\nWith [From.GetHerHis] visit nearing its end, this might be my last chance to ensure the continued alliance of our two realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHA20077;Despite my continuous efforts to prove otherwise, I have been unable to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is a respectable and powerful realm, one that has abandoned its tribal roots entirely.\nYet, with [From.GetHerHis] visit nearing its end, this might be my last chance to ensure the continued alliance of our two realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF20078;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20078;I am afraid I have other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20079;Only a few days before my departure from [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] graces me with an unexpected private meeting in my chambers. After hesitating about the subject of [From.GetHerHis] visit for a while, the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] finally confesses that, during these past days, [From.GetSheHe] has developed a deep affection for me and wishes to know if I feel the same about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20079;Of course I love you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20079;No, I do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20080;With only a few days left before my departure from [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] took some time during our last dinner together to ask me if, after learning more about [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] realm, I have come to consider [From.GetHerHim] a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20080;We're more like acquaintances...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20081;With only a few days left before my departure from [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] took some time during our last dinner together to tell me how honored [From.GetSheHe] was to host a guest as distinguished as myself and that [From.GetSheHe] hopes this will not be the last time we meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20081;I assure you, the honor was indeed all yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20082;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was thrilled by my marriage proposal, so much so that [From.GetSheHe] insisted we organized the ceremony in [Root.Capital.GetName] immediately. With this union, an alliance between [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been ensured for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20082;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20083;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] politely rejected my proposal before excusing [From.GetHerselfHimself] and leaving. With [From.GetHerHis] refusal the chance to bind our realms together permanently has passed me by.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20083;Maybe [From.GetSheHe] will change [From.GetHerHis] mind in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20084;I was relieved to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] does reciprocates my feelings for [From.GetHerHim]. We spent our last night together consuming our passion, thus ensuring the continued alliance between our two realms, just in time for [From.GetHerHis] departure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20084;See you soon, my love!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20085;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] politely rejected my advances before excusing [From.GetHerselfHimself] and leaving. With [From.GetHerHis] refusal the chance to bind our realms together permanently has passed me by.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20085;It was not meant to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20086;I was glad to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] considers [From.GetHerselfHimself] a friend of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], just as I consider myself a friend of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Hopefully, our relationship will ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for both our realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20086;As long as we both live, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20087;Unfortunately, despite [From.GetHerHis] attempts to assure me that we are not enemies, I remain doubtful of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s friendship. I am afraid our realms may not remain at peace for long.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20087;That is a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20088;It has finally come the time for the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to leave [Root.Capital.GetName] and return to [From.GetHerHis] realm. I can only hope that, during [From.GetHerHis] visit, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has come to appreciate me and my people and that [From.GetSheHe] will now see us as more than simple tribal converts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20088;Only time will tell...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20089;The time has finally come for me to leave [From.Capital.GetName] and return to my own realm. Living with [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s tribes was certainly an interesting experience. By going to personally meet the new converts, I truly have done everything in my power to put these pagans on the right path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20089;I truly am a pious [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CHRONICLE_SPONSOR_VISIT;[sponsoring_king.GetTitledName] decided to travel to [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in order to meet [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] and witness the effects of the mass conversion of [converting_king.GetHerHis] realm in the aftermath of the great ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE20090;The Conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20090;The tribes of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have been converted to the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith. A group of priests sent by the [sponsoring_king.GetTitle] of [sponsoring_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have performed a great ritual during which they have converted the entire population of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] alongside [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] and many of [converting_king.GetHerHis] vassals.\nWith this act, the people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have once and for all forsaken their old pagan gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF20224;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20225;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nYour request is frankly ludicrous.

EVTOPTAHF20225;If this is the will of God...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20225;This request is absurd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20226;As such is the will of the Holy See, I decided to formally submit myself and my Empire to the sacred authority of the Universal Church.

EVTOPTAHF20226;Surely it is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20230;The Holy See has seen fit to press its ancient claim over my lands, and, in [From.GetHerHis] wisdom, my liege has decided to grant him his request. As such, it appears I have now become a vassal of the Holy See.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA20232;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has died: with [From.GetHerHim] gone I must find another priest to anoint me [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF20306;And yet, maybe I should keep my distance from [potential_friend.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20307;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has spared no expenses for [From.GetHerHis] coronation. As I was admiring the lavish sights offered by [From.GetHerHis] palace, I was approached by the [From.GetTitle] [From.GetHerselfHimself]. After having talked to [From.GetHerHim] for a while, I am starting to think we might have a lot in common...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20307;Let us join our realms in friendship!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAHF20307;will receive your request of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20307;And yet, maybe I should keep my distance from [potential_friend.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20308;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has cheerfully accepted my offer of friendship. I was not wrong putting my trust in [From.GetHerHim], and now, thanks to this fortuitous meeting, we have both ensured a lasting peace between our two realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20308;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has cheerfully accepted my offer for friendship. I was not wrong in putting my trust in [From.GetHerHim], and now, thanks to this fortuitous meeting, I have further guaranteed the stability of my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20308;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20309;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not seem to share my feelings and politely refused my offer of friendship. While [From.GetSheHe] was hardly rude or confrontational, it is unfortunate that we could not see eye to eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20309;Maybe [From.GetSheHe] will change [From.GetHerHis] mind in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20310;Organizing such a great ceremony has given me the chance to know better some of my vassals. Maintaining healthy relationships with all my subjects is fundamental to ensure the future stability and prosperity of my realm. [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] in particular seems like a [potential_friend.GetManWoman] I could really trust...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20310;Could we be friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20310;And yet, maybe I should keep my distance from [potential_friend.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20311;Meeting new rulers and exchanging ideas about politics and royal virtues has been an interesting consequence of this ceremony. Everybody has at least one anecdote to share with me about the proper way to rule a Kingdom. I wonder which is closer to the truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20311;Fostering good relations with one's neighbors and subjects is paramount.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20311;Proper handling of the realm's finances is fundamental.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20312;During the evening, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has remarked on multiple occasions of how it is important for a new ruler to create stable diplomatic relationships with [From.GetHerHis] peers and subjects in order to ensure peace and prosperity for everyone. [From.GetHerHisCap] show of dialectics has been a revelation for all the guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20312;I might even learn something from [From.GetHerHis] example.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20313;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has entertained [From.GetHerHis] guests during the evening with a remarkable show of knowledge in the matters of State. While tedious to a few of the guests, some of the ideas we all discussed about how to improve and solidify a realm's economy were quite inspirational.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20313;I wonder if I could apply them on my own holdings...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20314;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName]'s presence for my upcoming coronation has lured an entire flock of scholars and theologians in my court. While most of them keep their distance from the nobility, I have had the chance to overhear a few of them discussing about the most intriguing, metaphysical subjects during the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20314;I will keep listening to them in the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20314;I will join the conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20315;...I might be learning something useful tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20316;With so many distinguished guests having traveled all the way to my court, the least I could do is entertain them while we all wait for the day of my coronation. This could also provide me with an opportunity to impress some of my more influential guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20316;Having all the important grownups in my palace is great opportunity to show them that I am just as smart and wise as any [Root.GetTitle] no matter how old I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20316;Hear me, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAHF20316;Attempt to use §YDiplomacy§! to impress your guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20316;I do not want to embarrass myself before the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20317;Whatever doubts I might have had about my performance were completely unfounded: my speech about the duties of a good [Root.GetTitle] to [Root.GetHerHis] subjects was poignant and extremely well received.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20317;When I started I was shaking a bit, but, after I finished listing all the responsibilities my tutor taught me about being a good [Root.GetTitle], all my guests applauded and congratulated me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20317;Phew...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAHF20317;All of the guests' opinion is increased by §G+10§! because of your speech.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20318;Despite my best efforts, my speech about the duties of a good [Root.GetTitle] to [Root.GetHerHis] subjects was received a bit too coldly compared to my expectations. Perhaps I should have used less platitudes and talked about something more substantive...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20318;Just while I was in the middle of listing the duties of a good [Root.GetTitle] like my tutor taught me, somebody in the crowd coughed and I lost my concentration! After a few failed attempts at resuming my speech, I was too embarrassed to continue and left the room covering my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20318;Ugh, this could have gone better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAHF20318;All of the guests' opinion is lowered by §R-10§! because of your speech.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20319;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time decanting the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. [From.GetHerHisCap] speech was passionate and on point, enough to convince many of the people present that [From.GetSheHe] will be an extraordinary ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20319;The young [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time listing the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. It was quite surprising to see a child show already such wisdom, so much so that, after [From.GetHerHis] speech, many were convinced that, despite [From.GetHerHis] young age, [From.GetFirstName] might make a great [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20319;Myself included.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20320;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time decanting the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. Sadly, [From.GetHerHis] speech was stale and filled with platitudes, and not many believed in the conviction that [From.GetSheHe] proclaimed to have.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20320;The young [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time listing the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. Unfortunately, the child was not up to the task and stopped midway through [From.GetHerHis] speech, rushing away, red with embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20320;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20321;I can almost feel the weight of the crown over my head already, but it is far from burdensome: I feel reinvigorated by the prospect of finally becoming [Root.GetTitle]. Thinking about my new responsibilities as an anointed ruler fills me with trepidation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20321;I shall be the greatest [Root.GetTitle] ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20321;This is a sign to stop slouching and take my work seriously.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20322;With all this pomp and circumstance, all these lavish preparations, and with my coronation so close, I am finally starting to understand the weight and importance of my role as [Root.GetTitle]. People expect great things of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20322;And I will not disappoint them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20322;Yet I should not let pride blind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20323;Everybody is so kind and respectful to me, even a lot of important people that I only met a few days ago. This Coronation Ceremony is a lot more important than I had thought. It is really great to be a [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20323;I am the most important person EVER!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20323;I should work hard to show that I know how important this is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20324;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] approached me tonight to personally inform me of how satisfied [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] is with the great month of festivity I have organized to accompany my coronation. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] wanted to be sure that I knew of how welcome [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] feels at my court, and that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] expects great things of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20324;I am flattered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20325;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] approached [From.GetTitledFirstName] tonight to personally inform [From.GetHerHim] of how satisfied [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] is of the great month of festivity [From.GetSheHe] has organized to accompany [From.GetHerHis] coronation. [coronation_priest.GetFirstName] wanted to be sure that [From.GetTitledFirstName], as well as everyone within earshot, knew of how welcome [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] feels at [From.GetHerHis] court, and that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] expects great things of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20325;It surely is an impressive ceremony...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20326;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] took some time after dinner to take me aside and give me a long talk about what my new responsibilities will be after [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] crowns me Holy Roman Emperor. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] warned me that being the heir to Charlemagne, as well as the protector of all Christendom will be a colossal undertaking, and that I should always strive to do my best to live up to the charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20326;I will bring new glory to the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20326;Tell me more about Charlemagne and the Emperors of old...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20326;I will work tirelessly to be a worthy successor to this great man.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20327;Late this evening, as the servants were clearing up our tables, [coronation_priest.GetTitledName] decided to talk to me about my new responsibilities after the coronation: as a [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle], I will be sworn to care for the secular needs of all my subjects as well as to stand against the tide of sin and heresy beseeching our world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20327;The world will never know a more devout [Root.GetTitle] than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20327;Let us talk about the details of these responsibilities...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20327;Empty words and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20328;I can only imagine what pressure [From.GetTitledFirstName] must be under, to be given the responsibility of an entire realm while so young must be overwhelming. Perhaps I should take some time aside before dinner and try to teach [From.GetHerHim] a few things about being a good [Root.GetTitle], and thus repay the kindness [From.GetSheHe] did me by inviting me to such a lavish celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20328;Your [From.GetHonorific], could you lend me your ear for a moment?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20328;I am sure [From.GetSheHe] will be able to handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20329;I was just preparing myself for dinner, when [From.GetTitledFirstName], one of my foreign guests, decided take me aside, offering to teach me a few things that a good [Root.GetTitle] should know in order to rule wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20329;I want to know! Tell me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPHF20330;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is pleased to help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20329;You are not my tutor, we are equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPHF20331;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is displeased of your refusal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20330;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was happy to learn more about [From.GetHerHis] upcoming responsibilities as a [From.GetTitle] from me. I am sure that what I told [From.GetHerHim] tonight will be of great use to [From.GetHerHim] in the future, and it will make [From.GetHerHis] realm more prosperous as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20330;A good action is its own reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20331;Perhaps [From.GetTitledFirstName] is too young to understand that I was only attempting to aid [From.GetHerHim]: [From.GetSheHe] did not listen to my words and dismissed [From.GetHerselfHimself] as soon as [From.GetSheHe] could. This sacred ceremony might well be just a big game for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20331;Such is the foolishness of youth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20332;I was surprised tonight when [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] stated that the period of festivity I have organized is unfit for the severity of the holy charge I am about to receive. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] has concluded [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] scolding by remarking that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] has witnessed many impious acts and degenerate behavior during [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] visit that have left [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] shocked and repulsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20332;Clearly [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] is exaggerating...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20333;Many tonight were surprised when [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] stated that the period of festivity [From.GetTitledFirstName] has organized is unfit for the severity of the holy charge [From.GetSheHe] is about to take. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] has concluded [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] scolding by remarking that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] has witnessed many impious acts and degenerate behaviors during [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] visit that have left [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] shocked and repulsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20333;Our host should be ashamed of [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20335;It was not enough to learn that [From.GetTitledFirstName] was at [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s celebration: tonight, in the middle of dinner, my old rival decided to insult me in front of my host and many of the other guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20335;I would be quite enjoying my visit at [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s court if it were not for [From.GetTitledFirstName] constant harassment. The [From.GetManWoman] is clearly jealous of my accomplishments as [Root.GetTitle], and cannot stop trying to besmirch my reputation, hoping it would make [From.GetHerHim] feel better about [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20335;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20336;It was not enough to learn that [From.GetTitledFirstName] was at [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s celebration: tonight, in the middle of dinner, my old rival decided to insult me in front of my host and many of the other guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20336;I would be quite enjoying my visit at [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s court if it were not for [From.GetTitledFirstName] constant harassment. The [From.GetManWoman] is clearly jealous of my accomplishments as [Root.GetTitle], and cannot stop trying to besmirch my reputation, hoping it would make [From.GetHerHim] feel better about [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20336;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20337;A heated argument has sparked between [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetTitledFirstName], two of my distinguished foreign guests. Whatever their reasons, this diplomatic incident could be a stain on the legitimacy of this ceremony if not properly handled.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20337;I am sure I can make them see reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAHF20337;Attempt to use §YDiplomacy§! to calm the two rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20337;I better not interfere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20338;Thanks to my diplomatic skills I was able to not only stop the argument between the two rival rulers from escalating, but to also mend their disagreements permanently. We talked long after the dinner was over and when the two of them retired to their rooms for the night they professed that they have found a new friend in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20338;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with the argument I was in. While at first I was doubtful [From.GetSheHe] could offer any help, [From.GetHerHis] intervention was enough not only to stop my rival's unjust accusations, but also to help clear any disagreements we might have had with each other permanently. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has proven [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a true friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20338;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20339;Thanks to my diplomatic skills I was able to not only stop the argument between the two rival rulers from escalating, but to also mend their disagreements permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20339;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with the argument I was in. While at first I was doubtful [From.GetSheHe] could offer any help, [From.GetHerHis] intervention was enough not only to stop my rival's unjust accusations, but also to help clear any disagreements we might have had with each other permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20339;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20340;Unfortunately, my attempt to help my two guests calm down were unsuccessful. In the end, I was forced to leave them to their bickering, lest I was dragged in the fight as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20340;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere in the argument I was in. While [From.GetHerHis] intentions were good, [From.GetHerHis] attempt to mend the disagreements I have with my rival was fruitless. This is no problem that can be fixed with a simple talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20340;Shameful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20341;Unfortunately, my attempt to help my two guests calm down were unsuccessful. Even worse, at the end of the dinner, I had somehow managed to convince both [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetTitledFirstName] that I was as much an enemy to them as they were to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20341;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere in the argument I was in. As if that was not embarrassing enough, I am now certain that [From.GetSheHe] favored my rival's reasons over mine, a clear breach of [From.GetHerHis] duty as host to be welcoming to all [From.GetHerHis] guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20341;This is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20342;There [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] goes again, scolding [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s guests with another sermon. It has been days now since I have had to put up with [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] endless moralizing, I cannot really take anymore of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20342;I will shut [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] up this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20342;[coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] is the [coronation_priest.GetTitle] after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20364;My celebrations have been interrupted by a heated argument between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] about the nature of devotion. I should probably put a stop to this before things escalate further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20364;Let me clear things up for both of you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20364;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20364;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20364;I better not interfere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20343;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with my argument with [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName]. While [From.GetSheHe] forced me to stop from further deriding the [coronation_priest.GetTitle], [From.GetSheHe] was also kind enough to recognize the validity of some of my complaints about [coronation_priest.GetFirstName]'s behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20343;At least [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] stopped preaching...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20344;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with my argument with [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName], and predictably, the [From.GetTitle]-to-be decided to take the side of the [coronation_priest.GetTitle]. There is no doubt in my mind that [From.GetSheHe] did so only because [From.GetSheHe] does not wish to risk losing the officiant of [From.GetHerHis] coronation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20344;What a hypocrite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20345;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with my argument with [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName], and surprisingly, the [From.GetTitle]-to-be took my side, going against the [coronation_priest.GetTitle] who is supposed to crown [From.GetHerHim] only a few days from now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20345;I will not forget your kindness, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20346;This morning, a curious visitor came to my court: he is a wandering knight who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He has proclaimed that he wishes to pledge his sword to my service. He is ready and eager to serve a [Root.GetTitle] as wise and renown as I am to his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20346;This morning a curious visitor came to my court: he is a wandering knight who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He has proclaimed that he wishes to pledge his loyalty to me and protect my honor from all offenders. He is ready and eager to defend the reputation of a [Root.GetTitle] whose virtue is as renown as mine to his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20346;This morning a curious visitor came to my court: he is a wandering knight who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He has proclaimed that he wishes to pledge his loyalty to me and protect me from any who would attempt to harm me. He is ready and eager to join the ranks of my bodyguards and shield my life with his.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20346;You are welcome, [coronation_knight.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20346;Begone, I do not know you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20347;It was hard to notice at first, but, after spending a few days with him in my service, I have come to realize that [coronation_knight.GetFirstName]'s devotion to me goes well beyond the boundaries of loyalty between a knight and his [Root.GetTitle]. Tonight, I pressed the issue with him, only to have [coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName] kneel at my feet and profess his undying love for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20347;Oh, I love you too, [coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20347;Can we not just be friends instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20347;Unacceptable. You are relieved of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBHF20347;[coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName] leaves your court forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20348;Giving into my lust for [coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName] may have been a poor choice, especially at this time: with the court so filled with guests for my impending coronation, somebody ended up spotting the two of us while we were consuming our illicit relationship in the gardens. Now, the entire palace is ablaze with vicious rumors about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20348;Who could have seen us?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20349;Rumors have reached me that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has fallen in love with a black knight who only arrived at her court a few days ago. Stories about her illicit escapades with this stranger of low birth put a notable stain on [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s reputation: why should she engage in such a vile behavior, especially when so close to her sacred coronation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20349;She should be ashamed of herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20350;It has been a great idea allowing [coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName] to join my court. He knows so much about fighting! He has told me all sorts of stories about the countless wars he has fought in, and he has even offered to teach me some of his tricks, if I can spare him some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20350;Yes! I want to know how to fight like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20350;Nah, I am not interested in that stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20351;This morning, a curious visitor came to my court: a wandering scholar who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He claims that he has heard many tales of what a wise and virtuous ruler I am, and wishes to put his knowledge to my service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20351;I am sure we have much to share, [coronation_scholar.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20351;You are welcome, [coronation_scholar.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20351;I do not deal with beggars and charlatans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20352;Everybody is praising [From.GetTitledFirstName], everybody is saying what a great [From.GetTitle] [From.GetSheHe] will make... If nothing else, this Coronation Ceremony has really made me realize how much I despise that [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20352;Everybody is praising [From.GetTitledFirstName], everybody is saying what a great [From.GetTitle] [From.GetSheHe] will make... I cannot stand the sight of my old rival being showered with compliments. Being invited to [From.GetHerHis] moment of glory was an insult of its own, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20352;I have had enough of this farce!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20352;I must be quiet and endure it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20353;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to make a scene during tonight's feast. Perhaps inviting my old rival to my coronation might have been a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20353;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to pick a fight with me during tonight's feast. For whatever reason, [From.GetSheHe] has come to the conclusion that I am an ungrateful hypocrite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20353;I am sure I can settle this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20353;Well, I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20354;In a surprising show of kindness, [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to listen to my grievances against [From.GetHerHim] and promised to improve [From.GetHerHis] behavior towards me in the future. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is not such a bad person after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20354;Let us not be enemies any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20355;I am soon to become [Root.GetTitle], yet here I am, alone in my palace, with only a few servants to celebrate what is supposed to be one of the most important days of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20355;At least I am safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20355;This is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20356;However justified my reasons were to organize a secluded ceremony for my coronation, rather than waste money and time on feasts and entertainment, my vassals are far from pleased. Not only do they perceive it as a sign of weakness, but they all seem to have taken their lack of invitation as a personal slight against them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20356;It was to be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20357;I have only heard of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s pending coronation after the news spread across the realm. It seems that the [From.GetTitle] has organized a very secluded ceremony for [From.GetHerHis] coronation, granting invitations only to [From.GetHerHis] most inner circle of advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20357;How dare [From.GetSheHe] not invite me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20358;After growing increasingly hostile in the past few days, tonight [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] officially stated [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] disappointment at my lack of hospitality, publicly berating me in front of my Council and servants for how poor and secluded this coronation is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20358;This is very rude of [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20359;It came to me as no surprise that [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] was disappointed with the secluded ceremony my liege organized for [From.GetHerHis] coronation. The [coronation_priest.GetTitle] probably hoped for a much more grandiose ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20359;Understandable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20360;What will wearing a crown change when nobody is even here to see me be anointed [Root.GetTitle]? Is my realm destined to be as hollow and forgettable as this ceremony is going to be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20360;I should just be content with what I have, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20360;Why should I even care about ruling?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20361;Spending the days leading up to my coronation in seclusion has given me time to meditate about my duties as a [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle]. Perhaps I have been too egoistical in the past, perhaps this ceremony is my chance to be a humbler, kinder ruler...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20361;Perhaps...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20361;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20362;As I spend my evenings alone, counting the days left before my coronation, I cannot shake the feeling that I would have been able to afford a more lavish ceremony if it were not for [lazy_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]'s mismanagement of the realm's finances...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20362;It is all the Steward's fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20362;It is too late to point fingers now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20363;[From.GetTitledFirstName] accused me of mismanaging the realm's finances! [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that, if it were not for my poor handling of the realm's treasury we would have been able to organize a much more grandiose ceremony for [From.GetHerHis] coronation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20363;This is ludicrous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA20369;With the ceremony finally concluded and every guest returned home, I can resume my duties as [Root.GetTitle]: now that I have officially received the blessing of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church, the legitimacy of my divine right to rule is beyond doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20369;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20370;With the ceremony finally concluded, [From.GetTitledFirstName] bid me farewell and dismissed me from [From.GetHerHis] court, alongside all [From.GetHerHis] other guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20370;It is good to be back in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE20371;Scandalous Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20371;The Pope was baffled when I reached for the Imperial Crown in the middle of the ceremony and snatched away the golden circlet from his hands. Amongst the general amazement of the crowd of noblemen around us, I announced that from this day forward the Papacy would hold no longer any power over the Imperial throne, as it was the case for all Roman Emperors of old.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF20376;Superstitious rabble...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20377;Month after month, I receive news about another one of the Bishops of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] accusing me of wickedness during one of his sermons. For as long as I have not been officially crowned [Root.GetTitle], the clergy will take every opportunity to further undermine my rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA20379;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] stormed my private study this evening, berating me for not having managed to legitimize my rule over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] with a proper Coronation Ceremony yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20379;Look who is talking...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20379;Dear, allow me to at least explain the issue clearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20379;Rather than fighting, could we not do something more relaxing?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20379;Just leave me alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20380;The nerve of [From.GetFirstName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] dared to deflect my just criticisms of [From.GetHerHis] misconduct by pointing out that I have also yet to prove my legitimacy as [Root.GetTitle] before God. Sometimes I truly cannot stand [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20380;You are a failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20381;After listening to my harsh words, [From.GetFirstName] assured me that [From.GetSheHe] understands perfectly the severity of our situation and has already put in motion [From.GetHerHis] plans to solve the issue as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20381;Maybe I should give [From.GetHerHim] another chance...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20382;As I was berating [From.GetFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] failings as [From.GetTitle], [From.GetSheHe] decided to drown my complaints in a kiss, and whispered to me that I should stop my bickering and join [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] chambers instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20382;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20382;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20383;It seems my [GetFromRelation] was not in the mood tonight. My attempt to distract [From.GetHerHim] from the issue of my pending coronation did not end quite well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA20384;My liege's rule has yet to be properly legitimized by the holy right of coronation. I must inform [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] current condition is becoming a hindrance to my work as Chancellor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20384;[From.GetSheHeCap] will not like to hear this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20385;My Chancellor informed me today that my prolonged lack of legitimization in the eyes of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church is seriously damaging all diplomatic missions of my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20385;I must find somebody to crown me soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20386;I can no longer suffer to serve under a wicked [From.GetTitle] who has yet to have [From.GetHerHis] rule be legitimized by the blessing of the Church. It is time that I make my disapproval known beyond doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20386;I will no longer serve in your Council!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20386;Maybe I should give [From.GetHerHim] some more time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20387;In a brazen display of disrespect, [From.GetTitledFirstName] proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] would no longer serve as the Court Chaplain of a wicked [Root.GetTitle] whose rule is still yet to be legitimized by the blessing of the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20387;I must find somebody to crown me soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20388;Some time has passed, but I still cannot come to terms with how modest and secluded my coronation has been. Is it worthy of an [Root.GetTitle] to have [Root.GetHerHis] divine right to rule be recognized in the most meager of fashions?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF20388;The Lord cares not for riches.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA20392;I am still thinking about [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s coronation. While I was forced by Fate to be crowned alone and in misery, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] flaunted [FromFrom.GetHerHis] munificence with all [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guests and put up a spectacle that will be remembered for years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20392;I am still thinking about [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s coronation.

EVTDESCHFA20396;I have been informed that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has come to [Root.Capital.GetName] and has requested an audience with me in order to pay me homage, as is tradition for a newly-appointed vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20396;Very well, send [From.GetHerHim] in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20396;I do not have time to waste with the likes of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20397;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was courteous enough to accept my homage and offer [From.GetHerHis] blessing as well. Now that this nuisance has been dealt with, I am free to return to my lands and rule in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20397;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20398;I was shocked to learn that [From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to grant me an audience, especially after all the trouble I have gone through only to pay [From.GetHerHim] homage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20398;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20399;According to legend, nested within the Iron Crown of Lombardy rests one of the sacred nails used to crucify Our Lord. Yet, after wearing this crown on my head for years, I have yet to see any trace of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20399;Perhaps I can pry it a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20399;I do not need to see it to know that it's there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20401;[GetFromRelation]'s crown is amazing! [From.GetSheHeCap] says only the [From.GetTitle] can wear it, but I am [From.GetHerHis] [Root.GetSonDaughter], and is that not close enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20401;So shiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20402;I was woken up this morning by disturbing news: a guard stormed in my bedchambers to warn me that my crown had been stolen.

EVTDESCHFA20403;My [GetFromRelation] caught me! Fortunately, [From.GetSheHe] was not too upset that I had taken [From.GetHerHis] crown. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] took me aside and told me a long story about the ancient Kings the crown belonged to before getting to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20403;Oh...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20404;My [GetFromRelation] caught me! [From.GetSheHeCap] was really mad to discover that it was I who took [From.GetHerHis] crown. [From.GetSheHeCap] had me dragged back to my chambers and made me skip both lunch and dinner!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

pregnancy_finishing_desc;This woman has entered the last phase of her pregnancy. Her condition is preventing her from taking part of her public life, at least until the time her labor comes to term.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celibate_mom_dec;Become Celibate;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celibate_mom_dec_desc;I have faced a particularly troublesome pregnancy. The next one could be lethal. Maybe it would be best to abstain rather than risk death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB316;My labor worsened the already precarious condition I was in. The midwives look worried, and I feel so terribly weak... I am bound to my bedroom, in a state halfway between nightmares and reality, struggling, on the brink of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA316; Despite my physicians' assurances to the contrary, giving birth only worsened my condition. The midwives look worried, and I feel so terribly weak... I am bound to my bedroom, in a state halfway between nightmares and reality, struggling, on the brink of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20400;Pregnancies come with considerable risks. Now that I am with child I ought to appoint a regent who can take over if anything should happen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20400;I will think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20404;As the time passes, I feel more and more restless. The changes in my body are constraining me, making hard what were simple actions once. It has been days since I have been out in the fields... This is all so frustrating!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20404;I must endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20405;My [GetFromRelation] seems to be going through a particularly harsh pregnancy. Perhaps it would be best for her to retire for a few months from public life and think of her health during this delicate period of her life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20405;I will tell my [GetFromRelation] to take leave for the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20405;She can think for herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20406;My dear [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is worried about my current condition. [From.GetSheHeCap] believes it might be better for me to retire from public life for the duration of this pregnancy. I can leave someone else in charge of affairs as I tend to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20406;My Court Physician is worried about my current condition. [From.GetSheHeCap] has advised me to retire from public life for the duration of this pregnancy. I can leave someone else in charge of affairs as I tend to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20406;It sounds like a great idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_staying_court;Inform your [GetFromRelation] that you will take leave and remain confined in your private quarters for the duration of the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20406;I'd better leave the [Root.GetHouse] entirely then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_going_countryside;Inform your [GetFromRelation] that you will take leave and spend your pregnancy in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20406;Nonsense, I feel perfectly fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_keeps_ruling;Inform your [GetFromRelation] that you will keep ruling for the duration of the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20407;This pregnancy is becoming a greater burden than I initially imagined. If I am not careful about my health, I may risk both my life as well as the child's. Perhaps I should take leave and spend the rest of the pregnancy in reclusion, looking after myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20407;Sounds like a great idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_staying_court_2;Retire and let your Regent take charge while you spend the last months of your pregnancy in seclusion in your private chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20407;I'd better leave the [Root.GetHouse] entirely then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_going_countryside_2;Retire and let your Regent take charge while you spend the last months of your pregnancy away from court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20407;Nonsense, I feel perfectly fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_keeps_ruling_2;Continue to rule at your own risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20408;Thankfully, my [GetFromRelation] has taken my advice to heart and decided to spend the last months of her pregnancy in seclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20408;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20409;Thankfully, my [GetFromRelation] has taken my advice to heart and decided to spend the last months of her pregnancy away from court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20409;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20410;Unfortunately, my [GetFromRelation] has decided to ignore my advice and maintain a public presence even in her precarious state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20410;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20413;Curse them all! And the pox to this infernal piece of meat within me, stretching and destroying my body from the inside out! This is absolutely unbearable. I have snapped several times at my courtiers, even when I knew there was no good reason to do so, but I just cannot help it anymore! I want this to be over! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20413;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20413;Perhaps I should try to calm down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20414;It was only after the fifth course that I realized how much I had eaten last dinner. It has become so hard to tell when my body is already bloated, hosting a little insatiable pest. Perhaps I should stop bothering at all and just eat whenever I am hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20414;I am eating for two after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20414;I should still try to use moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20415;The maid apologized and tried to bring me back to my chambers, but I refused her hand and kept crying in the middle of the corridor until two servants dragged me to my private rooms. It is my fourth episode this week and I am not feeling like it will stop anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20415;Yet, how inspiring my tribulation is...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20415;I am a horrible person and a shame to my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20416;Drinking a little every night has helped me a lot with relieving some of the tension I have been experiencing since the start of this pregnancy. I have started to feel a little dizzy in the past few days, but it is not like I have to do anything important in the next months anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20416;I will ask the servants for another round before going to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20416;This is really irresponsible of me, I should stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20417;Just as I was finally being lulled into sleep by the slow rocking of the carriage, when the horses suddenly broke off the driver's control, sending my entire entourage charging out of the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20417;I will calm them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20417;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20418;I thought being away from court and enjoying the clean air of the countryside would help me release some of the tension of this pregnancy, but it has only made things worse. My health is deteriorating by the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20418;It is just some travel nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20418;My physician will help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20418;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s Physician will help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20418;Why is this happening to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20419;I thought being away from court and enjoying the clean air of the countryside would help me release some of the tension of this pregnancy, but [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] had other plans in mind. [Root.GetWildernessWeather];;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_violent_sandstorm_paragraph;A terrible sandstorm has engulfed my entourage, blinding the horses and leaving us lost in the desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_violent_storm_paragraph;A terrible storm has caught my entourage, deafening us all night with thunders and leaving us sore and completely damp in the morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20419;I will not let a simple storm break me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20419;I cannot stand this anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20420;I have just realized today that, even with the pregnancy finally being over, I have yet to stop my daily visits to the cellar. I should probably stop it, but, on the other hand, it *has* become some sort of tradition by now for me and many courtiers do agree I have had a sunnier disposition since I started doing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20420;No excuses: I cannot go on like this. I have to stop drinking so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20420;I have survived a difficult labor: a little sip here and there won't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20421;I thought that after the pregnancy I would go back being my usual self, but it seems I have gained a little weight. I am sure it is nothing to worry about, but still, reverting back to my old diet has not been as easy as I thought it would.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20421;I should try to eat more moderately now that I have no child to sustain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20421;What is wrong with a little indulging?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20422;This is the ninth servant I disciplined this week. The poor boy did not even cry as the guards flogged him. Now, I do not even remember what was the reason I was mad at the boy in the first place. The realization shook me: my temper has gotten really out of hand, what if I unleash it on my newborn child?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20422;I really have an anger issue...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20422;That will not be *my* problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20423;I have spent the last two days secluded in my chambers, refusing any food, too tired to move and too ailing to answer to any plead. I have given all myself to bring forth a new life into the world and now I feel empty, useless, discarded, alone. What was even the point of all that sufferance and anguish?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20423;I cannot simply give up now. I have a child to look after.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20423;There is no point in going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20424;As days go by, I find harder and harder to ignore how my wife seems to have been letting herself go since her pregnancy, ravaging meal after meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20424;She might use a little moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20424;She can take care of herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20425;Outrageous! My spouse just had the nerve to tell me that I have put on too much weight and that I should start eating less, as if recovering from the pregnancy was not hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20425;He *is* right after all. I should try harder to stop eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20425;Fat?! I will show him fat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20426;Every night my wife keeps going down in the cellar, drinking herself to sleep. It was bad enough that she was doing it during the pregnancy, but I hoped she would have grown out of this bad habit by now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20426;Maybe she needs a little more encouragement...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20426;There is nothing wrong in having a little bottle once in a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20427;My husband seems to have noticed my nightly visits to the cellar: this morning he voiced his concern about having a drunkard for a wife. He could have been a little more gentle about it after all I have been through in the last months...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20427;He is right! This behavior is unbecoming of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20427;He should learn to enjoy himself a little and stop patronizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20428;I hoped the solution would solve itself after the baby came out, but my wife's temper still remains a problem. I *could* try and tell her to calm a little, I suppose?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20428;What could go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20428;No, I am not feeling suicidal today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20429;My spouse, he *dared* to say I have a temper problem! After all I have done!! After all I have been through! He *dares* to complain, as if he has any right! Maybe I have become a little touchy after all the pain and stress I was exposed to in the last months, but that is understandable! What is *his* excuse?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20429;Hm... Perhaps I *do* have a temper problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20429;*Now* I really am angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20430;It has been months since I saw my wife in a cheerful mood: she does not speak, she barely eats, never leaving her chambers unless she really has to. Every night I hear her crying in her sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20430;I cannot bear to see her this way. I should talk to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20430;I really cannot stand her incessant moaning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20431;Today my husband talked a lot with me. Or rather to me, as I was not really in the mood for talking, myself. He was very gentle and tried to make me leave my room by inviting me to a private dinner. I do not know what to tell him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20431;I have suffered enough, perhaps this is my chance to live again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20431;I want nothing! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20432;My dear wife has finally listened to my advice. In a few weeks she might be back into shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20432;Good for her. And me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20433;It seems my advice fell on deaf ears. Every day that passes by my wife keeps stuffing herself like a goose. So much for moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20433;Ugh, we will need a larger bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20434;I cannot remember the last time I saw my wife drunk. She has recovered from her bad habit quite nicely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20434;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20435;All my pleads have been for naught: my wife keeps sneaking out every night to drown her sorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20435;I do not know what else to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20436;Surprisingly, even if she yelled at me when I talked about it, my wife seems to have finally resolved her anger issues. She is treating everybody better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20436;Hopefully this will last.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20437;Curses! I did not even manage to make my case: my wife just snapped at me and pushed me over the stairs. ...I think I broke something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20437;At least I am out of reach, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20438;It is such a relief to see my wife alive again! I was really starting to worry, but she finally managed to recover from her depression.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20438;Now if only she could stop talking for once in awhile...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20439;I do not know what to do with my wife anymore: I can barely recognize her, all gloom and pale, she looks like a ghost. She has become completely unresponsive to everything and everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20439;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20500;My health has quickly fallen in the last days to the point that I can no longer leave my bed. This pregnancy might be much more difficult than I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20500;Oh, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20501;Your wife's pregnancy is not going well at all. She can no longer leave her bed and has been barely conscious during the past few days. If she is not properly treated, she may well not survive the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20501;Your [GetFromRelation]'s health has experienced a sudden drop during the last week. If she is not properly treated, she may well not survive the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20501;My Court Physician will know how to help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPAHFP20501;Tell your wife that your Court Physician will take care of her in her time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20501;I am as good as any Physician. I will help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPBHFP20501;Tell your wife that you will put your skills as a Scholar to good use to help her in her time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20501;She needs a priest to pray for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPCHFP20501;Send a priest to comfort your wife in her time of need and pray for the salvation of her soul should the worst come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20501;She needs a shaman to protect her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPDHFP20501;Send a shaman to comfort your wife and cast the proper spells to facilitate her labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20501;The only thing she needs is me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPEHFP20501;Offer to comfort your wife in her time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHFP20501;She will manage on her own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20502;In her current state [From.GetTitledFirstName] is almost entirely defenseless. Her pregnancy might present me with the perfect opportunity to get rid of her permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20502;A nice poison will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20502;I will simply smother her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20502;No need to worry: she probably will die on her own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20503;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I saw the golden gates of Heavens before me. A creature of light flew over them, blowing in his horn to let me in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20503;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I saw the heavenly palace of Asgard and the battling fields of Valhalla where heroes of old were fighting against each other and alongside the mighty Aesirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20503;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I found myself riding over the vast planes. Then, suddenly, my horse left the ground and rose up, bringing me closer and closer to the ethereal clouds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20503;Help me through this, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20503;Is it my fate to join them already?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20503;The Great Blue Sky protects me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I saw a golden child fly before me, spreading his wings to welcome me in his embrace. Yet, my relief turned to horror as I realized his robes were covered in filth, and snakes were nesting among his curls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, the fiery pits of perdition opened below me, letting a host of horrid jinns emerge to crawl over my flesh and froth at my face with their boiling spits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I found myself in a dark and frozen cave. A sleek man was bound to a rock in its darkest recess, screaming and crying as two snakes were dropping poison in his eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I felt as if somebody was dragging me below the ground itself, to be crushed and suffocate under dirt and ashes. The grotesque spawns of Elrik then crawled beside me, crying and gnawing at my limbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20504;Begone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20504;Leave me be!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20504;I will not be trapped here forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20504;Let me out! I cannot breathe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20505;Worrying for my precarious state, my [GetFromRelation] decided to send [From.GetHerHis] best physician to help me through the last months of this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20505;All aid is welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20505;I do not want a charlatan poisoning me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20506;Worrying for my precarious state, my [GetFromRelation] decided to offer [From.GetHerHis] own skills as physician to help me through the last months of this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20506;All aid is welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20506;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no expert in these matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20507;[From.GetFirstName] has welcomed my physician to her bedchambers. Hopefully things will improve from today forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20507;[From.GetFirstName] has welcomed my offer to help her with her labor. Hopefully I will be able to save her as well as our child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20507;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20508;[From.GetFirstName]'s stubbornness knows no bounds: as she lays feverish in her bed, still she refuses my help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20508;I can only pray now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20509;My [GetFromRelation] has sent a priest to my bedchambers to help and comfort me with his prayers. Hopefully his words will bring me some comfort during my labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20509;Pray for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20510;My [GetFromRelation] has sent a shaman to my bedchambers to perform the proper rites and scare away any evil spirits that might be the cause for my current predicament.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20510;Protect me, o wise one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20511;The chalice slips from my fingers as my vision starts to go blurry. Usually it takes me longer to fall asleep, but tonight I really cannot keep my eyes open. Only when I start choking and spot my regent, peeking from the door with a leering look, I finally understand what has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20511;You...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20512;My plan worked and [From.GetTitledFirstName] choked on her own blood. I doubt anybody will suspect the cause for her untimely death to be anything but complications during her difficult pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20512;She is finally at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20513;It takes me some time to react to the sudden pressure on my face: I had just finally managed to fall asleep after a long, painful night of cramps and nightmares. When I finally gained full conscience I find myself with only little air left. I struggle for a few seconds, trying to push the pillow away or grab my assassin's arms, but it is all in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20513;Hmmmmnngfhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20514;I waited until [From.GetTitledFirstName] fell asleep, snuck inside her room and pushed a pillow over her face. She barely put up any fight and, after a few minutes, she stopped struggling entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20514;She is finally at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20515;I was about to drink my usual glass of wine to help me sleep, when a sudden retching forced me to hold it away for a moment. As I picked the glass once more, I noticed a strange smell coming from the wine. Just then, in my hesitation, I glimpsed at the reflection of my Regent [From.GetFirstName], ominously spying on me from my chamber's door with expectation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20515;Guards! Seize [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20515;Guards! Kill [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20516;My plan did not work: [From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow managed to discover my plot to kill her moments before I set the plan in motion. She steadily screamed for help and her personal guards came in to arrest me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFPA20516;No, wait, let me explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20517;My plan did not work: [From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow managed to discover my plot to kill her moments before I set the plan in motion. She steadily screamed for help and her personal guards came in to kill me on the spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFPA20517;No, wait, let me explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20518;I was hoping that I could finally have a night with a peaceful sleep when the contents of my stomach decided to strongly disagree. I was just about to stand up when I heard a rustle near my bed: I slowly opened my eyes to see [From.GetFirstName] standing beside me, holding a pillow over my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20518;Guards! Seize [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20518;Guards! Kill [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20519;[From.GetFirstName] promised that [From.GetSheHe] will visit me every day until my labor comes to term to offer me all [From.GetHerHis] support and [From.GetHerHis] prayer for a speedy recovery and a healthy childbirth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20519;That is really kind of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20520;I cannot stand up, I cannot lay down, even the gentler action sends shivers of pain through my body. If I do not do something about it, this pregnancy might be the end of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20520;I will call for my Court Physician.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20520;I need to hire a healer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20520;I need a priest!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20520;A shaman will exorcise the evil spirits plaguing me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20520;I can do this on my own, I just need to endure the pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20522;I turn again and again under my bedsheets, panting desperately for air. My throat has become dry and hoarse, making it even harder to breathe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20522;I am suffocating!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20523;The servants take away the last bucket filled with my vomit, but they are not fast enough to place the new one under my face. As I puke all over my bed, the stench provokes a new surge of nausea, making me shiver violently.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20523;Ugh... When will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20524;I tear off another bush of hair from my chest, trying to stop myself from scratching my arms and legs some more. Despite my best efforts to stop it, since a few days now dozens of rashes and spots of disgusting fur have started to dot my skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20524;This is horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20525;I spit out the glass of water, and order one of my servants to try it again. As the pregnancy progressed, everything has started to taste progressively worse, to the point that now even the blandest of foods and beverages feel like rusted copper in my mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20525;Utterly repulsive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20526;I feel the touch of the servants covering me yet another time as I stir under my bedsheets, sweating and shivering. I have long since lost the sense of time since this fever has started tormenting me. In fact, I can barely tell if I am awake or not most of the times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20526;Where..?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20527;As I spend more days wasting away in my bedroom, tormented by this pregnancy, I am finding it a lot harder to focus on anything. Things that I thought obvious now slip away from my mind, and I can hardly remember the names of half the people I seen moving back and forth from my rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20527;Who are you again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20528;Once again, I wake in the dead of night, covered in cold sweat, with my heart beating wildly and struggling to breathe. My throat is already sore, but I still manage to scream my lungs out for help. When the guards finally come in, it takes them some time to stop me from screaming entirely and to assure me that there is nothing I should be worrying about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20528;But I saw something! I saw..?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20529;One of my servants hangs a dish filled with yet another delicacy below my nose, but I quickly push it aside in disgust. I have barely the strength left to breathe, let alone to chew anything, and the growing cramps from your womb are making me feel nauseous at every turn, so much so that has become really hard for me to eat anything at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20529;I just wish to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20530;I stir and drool, twisting uncontrollably in my bed, despite my servants' best efforts to hold me still. I hear voices, both worried and threatening, echo around me, but everything is blurry and I have no idea what is happening to me, nor why I am unable to stop screaming and foaming at the mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20530;Ghgghghh...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20531;The servants come once more to change the bedsheets soaked in my blood as I scream and fruitlessly grasp for something to hold onto as I try to ease the pain that coursing through every fiber of my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20531;Let it stop! Please!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20532;I let out a whimper when the tooth rolls over my bedsheets, and then moan through my closed mouth as I feel the metallic taste of blood fill my throat and more teeth loosen from my weakened gums.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20532;Gllkh!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20533;Yet another servant girls falls asleep in the middle of her story as I keep staring at her, teeming with envy. It has been almost a week since I last managed to sleep properly. My eyes are bloodshot and my ears scream in pain at even the softest whisper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20533;I just want to rest! Even just an hour!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20534;Some of the servants seem to have been really started to worry about me since a few weeks, but in truth, I have not felt this good since quite some time, especially after since the talking fox brought some of his friends in my bedchamber to entertain me with their delightful escapades.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20534;Oh, Lord Butterfly, you are such a braggart!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20535;I startle as a pair of hands drags me back from the edge of the balcony. How did I even get here? The last thing I recall was trying to find the right position to sleep without squashing my womb...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20535;Who..? Who are you? Where am I?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20536;Things seem to be finally improving. I have resumed to sleep and eat regularly and the cramps have subsided. I may be able to see this labor to its end after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20536;Hopefully the worst has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20537;The servants are working tirelessly around me, changing bloodied bedsheets and brushing blood and sweat off of me, but there seems to be no end to it. The bleeding will not stop and I am too weak to endure any more pain and deprivation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20537;I cannot-;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20538;Given the ominous circumstances of my birth, I am clearly no ordinary child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20538;Guh?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20539;The pregnancy has been a hellish torture, but its fruit at least seems to have been a strong and healthy baby.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20539;My child...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20540;As if the terrible pregnancy was not enough, there seems to be something wrong with my child as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20540;Am I cursed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20541;The pregnancy is over, but I have yet to leave my chambers, scourged by a steaming fever which is leaving me shivering and burning under my bedsheets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20541;When will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20542;As I turn restlessly in my bed, I find another curl of hair laying severed amongst the sheets. There is no doubt anymore that the strain my pregnancy put me under is resulting in an alarming loss of hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20542;What is happening to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20543;My bleeding has yet to stop. Even with the child out, I am still experiencing frequent accesses, despite the best efforts of my healers to stop the flow of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20543;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20544;The horrific trial is finally over: I have fully recovered from the ordeal that was this pregnancy without any lasting scar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20544;I am a little bit tired still...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20545;I am finally starting to recover from the ordeal of this labor, but there is no doubt that this experience has considerably weakened me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20545;I might not survive another labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20546;Although my body is recovering from the pregnancy, the pain I endured has deeply scarred my mind. Every little sound puts me on alert and it is harder and harder to find the resolve to go outside of my room, even to perform the simplest task.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20546;I am so tired and- what was it again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20547;I hoped the pain would be over with the child out of me, but the internal bleeding I have suffered by giving birth to [From.GetHerHim] has made everything worse. As I lay in my blood-soaked bed, the servant desperately try to preserve what little spark of life I have left as I slowly slip into unconsciousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20547;It is over...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20548;My wife [From.GetFirstName] went through an extremely painful and dangerous labor, but she seems to have miraculously recovered from it without any permanent damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20549;My wife [From.GetFirstName] went through an extremely painful and dangerous labor and, while she managed to survive it, she has been left weakened and fragile after the ordeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20549;Is the womb still in working condition though?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20550;My wife [From.GetFirstName] went through an extremely painful and dangerous labor and, while her body managed to survive largely unscathed, her mind was unfortunately shattered by the hellish experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20550;At least the body is fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20551;My wife [From.GetFirstName] did not survive her pregnancy, dying of complications during her labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20551;At least she is at peace now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20552;The nightmare is not over yet for my wife: her recovery was only passing, her conditions have quickly worsened after giving birth to her child. If she does not get better soon, she will surely perish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20552;Labor is not going well. My wife is bleeding profusely and seems to be suffering great pains. If the bleeding does not stop soon she will surely perish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20552;May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20553;My treatment is finally showing some results: my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is sleeping and eating regularly again, and her cramps have subsidized. The pregnancy is not over yet, but she might be able to make it after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20553;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20554;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is sleeping and eating regularly again, and she claims to be feeling better. The pregnancy is not over yet, but she might be able to make it after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20554;This is wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20440;A little sip here, a small bottle there, it might not be what is best for the child, but drinking more has definitely help me cope with the stress of this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20440;I am not drinking *that* much anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20441;I feel a lot less under pressure since I stopped caring about what I eat. In fact, I have started to routinely look forward to gorge myself on whatever the cooks have prepared every day. Besides, it is all to make a healthy son.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20441;I will stop the moment the little thing is out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20442;The pregnancy seem to be getting on my nerves. Lately I have been more and more irate, sometimes lashing out at the smallest thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20442;I am surrounded by idiots!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20443;I do not know what day it is, or how long is left before this pregnancy is finally over. It feels as if I have always been in this bed. I cannot recall a single accomplishment of worth in my entire life. I feel hollow, worthless, and in constant pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20443;I am truly pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP20573;It does not matter 'what' as long as it is a LOT.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_mother_craved_all;You do not seem to crave for anything out of the ordinary. It is probably for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHFP20573;I will ask my husband about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20596;The pregnancy has caused my wife to develop quite the unusual tastes. Most of what she asks for dinner nowadays ranges from mildly unsettling to positively revolting. Still, scholars do agree that a pregnant woman's cravings should always be accommodated...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20596;I will make sure that she gets all she wants and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHFP20596;I have no money to spend on this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPB20574;My mother has not been feeling well lately. Going through a pregnancy is no easy task. Perhaps I should visit her and try to cheer her up a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20574;It occurred to me that my wife is feeling somewhat gloomy as of late. The burden of her unborn child is surely causing some humoral unbalance that is affecting her mood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20574;Whether it's guilt for her vile betrayal, or simply an humoral unbalance brought by her pregnancy, my wife has looked quite gloomy as of late. Perhaps she has finally started to understand the gravity of her crime against me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20574_B;Too late to feel sorry now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20574;I will buy her something nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP20574;I am sure she will be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20575;I can only imagine how [From.GetFirstName] must feel – as if being unable to publicly declare our feelings for each other was not enough, she now must lie about the fruit of our love.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20575;I can only imagine how [From.GetFirstName] must feel – as if being unable to publicly declare our feelings for each other was not enough, she now has to carry a child against her will.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tooltip_visit_lover;§Y[From.GetFirstName]§! will certainly be glad to receive a visit from her beloved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20575;It would be too dangerous right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20576;I was very surprised to find my husband waiting for me in my rooms tonight, surrounded by an entire collection of assorted presents. Apparently, he just wants to give me his best wishes for the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20576;Oh, dear, you really *do* love me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20576;Thank you, I really appreciate your gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20577;[From.GetFirstName] was extremely happy about the presents I bought for her. Right after seeing me, she jumped into my arms and gave me a passionate kiss. It looks like my kind gesture has really struck her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20577;I love you too, dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20578;[From.GetFirstName] decided to come visit me. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that [From.GetSheHe] was worried about my health, and so decided to spend the entire afternoon trying to cheer me up, asking questions about [From.GetHerHis] future brother, touching my belly, and trying to hear the baby inside. [From.GetSheHeCap] is such a sweet child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20578;[From.GetFirstName] decided to come visit me. [From.GetSheHeCap] worries about my health and wished to offer [From.GetHerHis] sympathies for my current condition. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] is quite eager to meet [From.GetHerHis] new baby brother or sister.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20578;My beloved husband decided to pay me a visit tonight. We have not had a lot of time to be together since the pregnancy started showing, so it was a much welcome surprise for me to meet him in private again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20578;You are going to be a wonderful big [From.GetSisterBrother], [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20578;Thank you for your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20579;I was right to go to Mother. She was much happier after I talked to her. She even told me I will be a great [Root.GetSisterBrother] for the new child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20579;I was right to visit my [GetFromRelation]. She is feeling much better now. Hopefully what I did will help her get through this pregnancy more easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20579;I hoe you are well, Mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20580;When I discovered [From.GetFirstName] lurking in my chambers I barely managed to restrain myself from screaming and accidentally call the guards on [From.GetHerHim]. My lover told me that [From.GetSheHe] wished to comfort me in this stressful period of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20580;I am so glad you came!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20581;The baby is finally out, and I can sleep easily once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20581;I feel liberated!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20582;My little [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a very talkative and cheerful [From.GetBoyGirl]. If only it weren't for that twisted foot of [From.GetHerHis]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20582;I wonder what caused it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20583;My little [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a silent [From.GetBoyGirl]. I worry that [From.GetSheHe] might be having a harder time learning to talk because of that harelip of [From.GetHersHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20583;I wonder what caused it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20584;My little [From.GetFirstName] may not be the cutest of children, but [From.GetSheHe] certainly has a very curious and inquisitive mind behind [From.GetHerHis] plain face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20584;I wonder who [From.GetSheHe] took after...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20585;It looks like all that time kicking in my belly was not just for show: my sweet [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a fierce and healthy [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20585;I am so proud of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20586;The gods are truly generous! My sacrifice was not in vain: [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a healthy and strong [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPA20589;My prayers have been answered! The seed planted within me was indeed that of a wonderful [From.GetBoyGirl], just as I had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20589;It looks as my prayers went unanswered. I was truly hoping to have something better than a [From.GetBoyGirl]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20589;My beautiful [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20589;And yet, I still love [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20589;I will just have to wait a little more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20590;The vow I made was not in vain. The Holy Virgin has blessed me with a healthy, strong [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20590;Perhaps I was not virtuous enough to gain the favor of the Holy Virgin: my vow did not help little [From.GetFirstName] to be born in good health.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20590;The Holy Virgin has turned her gaze away from me. Why else would she let my poor innocent child die before [From.GetSheHe] could even be baptized?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20590;I must still keep true to my vow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20590;I think it is time to turn my mind back to mundane concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20590;What have I done to offend you, Mother?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20591;As soon as I broke my vow, my poor child's health started to drop. It is only because of my sins that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] now suffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20591;What have I done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20594;I never knew how terrible it was for my mother to give birth to me until a few years ago, and only now I am starting to truly understand the deadly danger she put herself through in order to bring me into this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20594;I must talk to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_troubled_child_talks;Talk to §Y[From.GetFirstName]§! and show your appreciation for her care and endurance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20594;I think she already knows how I feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20595;Today [From.GetFirstName] decided to talk to me about [From.GetHerHis] birth. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] did not understand until very recently just how close I was to die when giving birth to [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] wished to openly show [From.GetHerHis] appreciation for my care and endurance, both during the labor and in the years following it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF20235;I cannot sully my name with this sacrilegious request.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20236;I can scarcely believe my eyes: the private feast organized by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is nothing more than a depraved orgy. All sorts of vile and shameless acts are taking place within the holy walls of [FromFrom.Capital.GetName], under the lecherous gaze of my guest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20236;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] made good use of my money: the holy walls of the Vatican have been filled to the brim with wine and whores. Soon after the start of the celebration for my upcoming coronation, the crowd of lechers and drunks invited to the party are already debasing themselves in the most abominable acts imaginable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFB20237;[Root.GetPapalOrgyIntro] The [coronation_priest.GetTitle] holds me by the shoulders, leering me with a drunken smile, and offers me a private communion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF20238;I am already in Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20239;When my guards come to recover me in the morning, I barely remember anything of what has happened last night.

EVTDESCAHFP20606;As I demand the servants to bring me another course of delicious red meat, my eyes fall down on my distended belly, placidly resting over my lap. My love of food is not having a positive effect on my health: if I do not do something about it, I may soon be in need of a wider throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20606;The servant girls chuckle as I pass by them on my way to the dining room. I catch only a few of their words before they hastily go back to their tasks, but it is clear that the source of their odious giggling is my wide, puffy hips. All of these large feasts I subject myself to have really started to ruin my figure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20606;As I crumple and throw away another disappointing report, I yell at my servants, demanding for more food. As of late, eating is the only thing that has provided me with some relief from the stress of leadership.

EVTDESCEHFP20606;I stuff another chunk of meat down my throat, lying over the empty dining table. My stomach is starting to hurt, but I cannot stop myself: eating is the only thing that brings a sparkle of happiness to my otherwise terrible existence. Why should I care if I get a little overweight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHFP20606;I cannot recall the last time I left my [Root.GetHouse] to take a walk or inspect my demesne. All of this slouching is turning me into a flabby pig, but so what? I am [Root.GetTitle], I was not meant for manual labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHFP20606;I cannot recall the last time I left my [Root.GetHouse] to take a walk or inspect my demesne. It has become quite difficult for me to keep my weight in check as of late, but so what? A lady of my stature should not demean herself with manual labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHFP20606;I incite one of my servants to keep stuffing me with more delicacies, reveling in the onset of titillating nausea coursing through my body from my distended belly. My pursuit of all of the most extreme earthly pleasures is proving to be quite taxing for my body, but is it not this a very small price to pay for absolute pleasure?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMHFP20606;It is not easy being a mother. I cannot take any risks with myself when my children's future depends on my own health. The days I could freely go out for a ride, or play with the other ladies outside are over. Now I am committed to stay at home, tend to my family, and be a big happy woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNHFP20606;It has been quite some time since I regularly went out hunting, or trained for combat. My body may no longer be what it used to, but spending more time at home with my beautiful wife gives me all the happiness I need in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOHFP20606;Another day passes by, spent sitting on my nice soft couch and gorging upon the last delicacies prepared by my cooks.

EVTDESCBHFP20613;I may have lost the graceful and slim figure I had during my youth, but my devotion to my duties as a mother has earned me the love and respect of all my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20613;And there is a lot of me to love!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_physique_beloved;Your §YRelatives§! have grown very fond of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20614;[From.GetFirstName] is such a caring [GetFromRelation], always ready to lighten up the mood during a somber family dinner or play with the children. Even though we may disagree from time to time, I cannot deny [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments as [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20614;People like [From.GetHerHim] are rare indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20615;I might no longer be able to satiate my lust in real life, but the spare time I gained because of my forced abstinence has allowed me to discover a deep appreciation for books. At the end of the day, all I need in order to be happy is a good romance and a full belly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20615;How thrilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20616;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has really been letting [From.GetHerselfHimself] go as of late. What was once a strong and energetic [From.GetManWoman] has slowly become a weak-willed and sedentary glutton, only excited about [From.GetHerHis] next great feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20616;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been really letting [From.GetHerselfHimself] go as of late. What was once a graceful and delicate [From.GetManWoman] has slowly become an undignified and hefty glutton, only excited about [From.GetHerHis] next great feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP20617;I was happy to hear from [From.GetFirstName] that [From.GetSheHe] is truly enjoying my new self. Just this morning [From.GetSheHe] told me of how better I've been looking since some time now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20617;How nice of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20618;Today [From.GetFirstName] took me aside for a minute for a private talk. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] is concerned about my growing weight and fears that if I do not change my dietary habits I may be jeopardizing my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20618;Outrageous! [From.GetFirstName] just told me that if I don't stop eating I will soon no longer be even be able to stand, let alone accomplish anything of note.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20618;[From.GetSheHeCap] has a point...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP20619;I was relieved to see that my words did not go unheard. [From.GetFirstName] thanked me for my concern and promised me that [From.GetSheHe] will start dieting immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20619;A wise choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20620;Unfortunately it seems as if my words have gone unheard. [From.GetFirstName] has ignored my warnings and still spends [From.GetHerHis] days stuffing [From.GetHerHis] face with all sorts of food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20620;All the worse for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20621;It has not been easy, but I think I am finally managing to get back in shape. Most of my old clothes have become too large for me and I can run a flight of stairs without arriving at the top drenched in sweat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20621;My diet is paying off.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20622;I have tried my best to stop eating so much, but it was all useless: despite all the tormented nights spent lying awake in my bed listening to the growling of my stomach, I cannot seem to lose any weight. I wonder if it is even worth keep trying anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP20629;This morning one of my servants caught me just in time to stop me from falling senseless on the ground. At first I thought nothing of it, but, after a good night to think about the curious episode, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps all these years spent abstaining from all but the simplest foods are starting to take a toll on my health...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20629;This morning I was found laying on the ground in my garden. I cannot recall exactly what happened, but the servants insist that I fainted while taking a walk. Perhaps all these years spent abstaining from all but the simplest foods are starting to take a toll on my health...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20629;There are so many things to do, so many responsibilities filling my mind, that I barely have any time left to sleep or eat. All this stress is turning me into a hollow shell of my former self, but what else can I do? The life of a [Root.GetTitle] is not easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20629;I give myself another look at the mirror, turning left and right, poking at my sides, looking for any trace of stretches or love-handles. A distinguished [Root.GetTitle] such as myself should strive to always look at [From.GetHerHis] best. Most people at court insist that I am ruining myself, eating so little, that it's not appropriate for any [Root.GetTitle] to be so thin, but what do they know?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHFP20629;My servant leaves my bedroom, carrying away another untouched dinner. It has been some time now since I had any appetite. My skin is slowly turning pale, growing tighter over my skeletal features, but I still find no point in taking any more food that is required for me to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHFP20629;No exercise and entire days spent without even bothering to get out of bed, coupled with a prolonged lack of appetite, are turning me into a pale shadow of my former self. All my physicians agree that my appetite would return if only I stepped outside my rooms every once in a while, but I have yet to find any truly legitimate reason to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHFP20629;It is well past midnight. All the other curators have left the library and all lights have been shut off... except for mine. My hands are shaky as they turn the pages of the old tome on my table, and large bags have appeared under my eyes, yet I cannot stop: what is a wasted body compared to an enriched mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMHFP20629;Day after day, I have pursued the teachings of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], forsaking all excesses and temptations. I may have grown pale and frail, yet I feel that my spirit grows stronger and purer at each new hour I spend in devout abstinence. I have long since come to relish in the cramps and growls coming daily from my stomach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOHFP20629;My eyes twitch from the bite of half-chewed roast to the line of waiters silently standing by the table: my suspects are immediately confirmed when I spot a young servant girl looking away from me. As the guards drag the traitorous woman away from my sight, I throw the dish at the other servants. Everybody is trying to poison me, how am I supposed to eat anything at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQHFP20629;Today I had to dismiss the polite concerns of another one of my Vassals regarding my health: it seems that many in my courts, while being very appreciative of the diligence with which I resolve any task or issue, are starting to fear I may be working myself to death: I always go to bed with bags under my eyes, and the smallest whiff of wind is enough to push me to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRHFP20629;This morning I had to rush to the gates to make sure an important missive was delivered before the Courier left the [Root.GetHouse]. At first, I chuckled when the servant mistook me for a pageboy, but now I have started to wonder if my dedication to my work and my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle] are becoming too vexing for my body to handle...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20629;I should probably sleep more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_rest_20600;Spare yourself more time to rest every day. It may yield smaller results compared to a drastic change in diet, but at least you will not risk relapsing into your old habits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20629;Wasting away like this is unacceptable for a warrior like me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_A;Nonsense, temperance is indispensable to maintain good health.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_B;Who has time for food anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_C;In fact, I'd rather not eat at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_D;Just another page...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_F;I must resist all temptations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_G;I cannot think of myself, there is just too much to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_H;I'd rather starve than be fooled by the likes of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP20629;No, this is too much! I need to eat something!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_physique_malnourished_resist;Force yourself to change your dieting and sleeping habits and get back in shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20630;I may have grown thin and emaciated, but I have never felt so alive! There is always something to be done, something to be fixed: my mind is always hungry for new challenges to overcome. The satisfaction of looking back at a job well done is the only sustenance that I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20630;Work, o blissful work!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20631;I have just realized that, since some time now, I have received more and more frequently visits from my family members. I am not sure if they think I am sick and about to die, or if they have simply taken pity on my miserable state, but they seem to be a lot more caring and polite when around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20631;Not that I care...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_physique_pitied;Your §YRelatives§! have taken pity on you, and as such, their opinion of you has increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20632;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been reduced in such a miserable state, laying every day in [From.GetHerHis] bed, starved and sobbing, that it has become really hard for anybody to go against the few wishes [From.GetSheHe] has left in [From.GetHerHis] skeletal body.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20632;Who could hate such a frail sad creature?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20633;The ambassador smiles politely at me and gives me his best wishes before leaving the court room. I can scarcely find anybody that doesn't appreciate my helpful and eager attitude. Having to take care of everybody's problems may be vexing, but has allowed me to significantly increase my network of friends and allies both at court and abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20633;I am always happy to be of service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20634;It has been quite some time since I returned to my bedroom to sleep regularly. I have been informed that several people in my court are worried about me, that I am going insane in my library, but they simply do not understand how imperative it is for me to continue my research. My frail, decaying body is a small price to pay for the arcane secrets I am discovering within these walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20634;A small price indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20635;Continued meditation has helped me expunge all base desires from my flesh. As my body grows weaker, I feel my soul reaching for the divine, every day a bit closer to its apotheosis. I have long since started to ignore the small-minded advices of my courtiers about sleep, food, or exercise. I am far beyond such mundane needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20635;I can almost feel ascending to the heavens already!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20636;I was surprised to realize that my continued and rigorous abstinence has considerably improved my health. It appears that my body was in need of a bit more moderation in order to work better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20636;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20637;Today I was nearly trampled by my own horse after I fainted while taking a ride. It seems that my eating habits have eroded my health considerably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20637;How could this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20638;Cutting on sleeping and eating times has really helped me getting ahead of my tasks. I may be looking ghastly, but I feel much better now that everything has been nicely fit into my schedule. As long as I keep skipping dinner and only sleep twice a week, I can fulfill all my responsibilities with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20638;I gaze once more into my mirror, giving a satisfied smirk to my reflection. It has not been easy resisting all temptations, but now I have finally gained the sort of slim, graceful figure that most ladies can only dream of. With not a single ounce of fat left on my body, I am surely going to be the envy of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20638;Such a relief!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20639;I still need to be very careful about what I eat, and make sure to sleep as little as possible, lest some one of those vile turncoats pretending to be my servants can have his way with me, but I am definitely getting better at spotting the guilty looks and traitorous brows amongst the forgettable faces of my staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20639;Shadows and poison are everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20640;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has not been taking care of [From.GetHerselfHimself] lately. The [From.GetManWoman] scarcely eats anything, never sleeps, and is quickly turning into a walking skeleton. If [From.GetSheHe] keeps going like this, [From.GetSheHe] might end up wasting away entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP20641;Just today my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has openly praised me for my enviable shape, as well as my exemplary show of constraint and dedication in all things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20641;Very nice of you to say so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20642;[From.GetFirstName] came in my room this morning to speak with me of [From.GetHerHis] growing concern for my health. [From.GetSheHeCap] believes that all this fasting might be putting me under serious risk and encouraged me to try and eat more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20642;The gall on my [GetFromRelation]! [From.GetSheHeCap] barged into my room this morning, telling me that I better start eating more before I starve myself to death, as if [From.GetSheHe] has any business meddling with my private life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP20643;I was relieved to see that my words did not go unheard. [From.GetFirstName] thanked me for my concern and promised me that [From.GetSheHe] will strive to lead a more balanced lifestyle in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20643;A wise choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20644;Unfortunately it seems as if my words have gone unheard. [From.GetFirstName] has ignored my warnings and still spends [From.GetHerHis] days wasting away in [From.GetHerHis] rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20644;All the worse for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20645;It was not easy to force myself to break my old diet, but things seem to be finally getting better. The bags under my eyes have disappeared permanently, my skin has taken on some color again and I feel less likely to faint every time I exert myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20645;I might need new clothes though...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20646;I have tried my best to ignore my natural instincts and force myself to eat more often, but it is of no use: every time I manage to take a little bite more than usual I end up feeling sick or puking everything out again. Dieting is making me feel worse than I ever was before. Perhaps I should just stop trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHFP20647;No armor is large enough to fit me, no horse strong enough to carry me. [Root.Capital.GetName]'s blacksmith is currently working day and night designing a new reinforced throne for my courtroom, just so I can have something that is stable and wide enough to sit on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHFP20648;I have come to the point where even loud noises upset me. I spend most of my days laying down, having my servants whisper the reports of the day and murmuring back my orders. My mind is still sound, but my body is growing too weak to sustain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20648;There was a day when I would revel in the envious gazes of other ladies looking at my slim figure, but not anymore: I have grown so frail and sickly that I can barely take a walk without risking to faint.

EVTOPTAHFP20655;What a lovely sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHAFP20658;I was shocked to hear [From.GetFirstName]'s response to my warnings: apparently [From.GetSheHe] thinks that I am not truly concerned about [From.GetHerHis] health, and that this is all a plot of some sort to lower [From.GetHerHis] self-esteem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHBFP20658;I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] realized I was lying or if it was just one [From.GetHerHis] paranoid streaks, but [From.GetFirstName] was not swayed by my words: in fact, [From.GetSheHe] openly claimed that I was trying to manipulate [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTHFP20606;I pull my hair in frustration and take another bite from my roasted beef, furiously chewing it down. I try taking a long breath to calm myself, but doing so only reminds me of my growing belly pressing against my clothes. The more I eat, the angrier I become, the angrier I am, the more I need to eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUHFP20606;The world is spinning, as something rolls by me, clinking against the floor. Is that the... tenth bottle I had? "Just heave..!" I command the group of strong young men, struggling to carry me back into my bedroom. Sensing their effort, the realization of how fat all this beer is making me, finally pierces through my drunken stupor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVHFP20606;I let out a long yawn and blink, waiting for the ceiling to stop spinning. My servants must have brought me back to bed after another night of drinking. As I turn my head down, my eyes meet the dome of my beer belly, peeking over my breasts, and I let out a giggle. This wild lifestyle has not been great for my health...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHFP20629;I spit the half-chewed bite of chicken in my handkerchief and push away the dish in disgust. It is of no use: since I have tasted the sweetest meat of all, every other food has become insipid and repulsive to my body. Finding proper game to fill my refined palate is not easy, and as such, I am now starving...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTHFP20629;I spit the half-chewed bite of chicken in my handkerchief and push away the dish in disgust. I cannot stand to eat anything less than human meat anymore. The very thought of filling my body with inferior creatures repulses me. Unfortunately, this means I can scarcely find anything to eat at all most days...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUHFP20629;I carefully examine the small piece of white meat on top of my knife, turning it left and right before placing it on the dish once more. So many people I know have died after having eaten rotten or impure food. If I want to live a long, safe life, I must sacrifice quantity for the sake of quality when it comes to eating.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_L;I cannot demean myself with inferior food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP20663;I place my fists on my side and smirk at my reflection. I am looking quite impressive as of late. A strong and powerful [Root.GetTitle] such as myself should look the part. I am the biggest man in [Root.Capital.GetName] and I wouldn't want to have it any other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20663;I give myself another look at the mirror, brushing my hands over my dress to follow the curves of my beautiful, rippling body. I dare anybody to mistake me again for one of those insipid, skinny peasant girls working around town. This truly is the look of a [Root.GetTitle]: imposing and majestic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20663;I couldn't agree more with myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20664;I take a deep breath and wait for the servants to try and push me on my horse for the third time. After a bit of struggling, the five boys manage to get me over the poor beast and I am finally ready to go. This extra weight of mine might give me trouble from time to time, but it has surely taught me the virtue of patience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20664;I hold my breath for the third time, and the two poor maids pull the strings of my dress pushing in the fat. I give them a few words of encouragements and pull in the opposite direction. This extra weight of mine might give me trouble from time to time, but it has surely taught me the virtue of patience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20664;What alternative could there be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20665;What else can a man pretend from life beside a full stomach? I loosen up my belt and let out a long sigh, letting my eyes go over the line of dishes still waiting for me on the table. Here in my [Root.GetHouse] I am happy, warm, and pampered. There is nowhere else I'd rather be, nothing else I'd rather be doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20665;I let out an satisfied mumble and sit back, rubbing my distended stomach and closing my eyes as I slowly fall asleep, ready to dream about my next meal. It is a simple routine I have fallen into since some time, but one that I quite enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20665;Life is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20666;So often rulers such as myself have fallen prey to temptation, surrounded themselves with the excesses granted by our station and subsequently forgot their duties.

EVTOPTAHFP20666;I must never forget this feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20667;Every day I look around I hear young men riding by my window, laughing and teasing each other, while my frail constitution forces me to remain confined to my rooms. I hate them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20667;This morning, while reading by my window, I spotted the cook's daughter sitting by the courtyard. That stupid peasant girl was happily stuffing herself like a goose. I, on the other hand, have barely any strength left in my jaws to chew the softest, smallest of foods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP20668;They think themselves so clever, the little rats. They all think they can poison my food, stalk in my bedroom at night and that I won't see them. They all think their pitiful pleas for mercy will save them. But they are wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHFP21013;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] used extremely magniloquent terms to describe how much [From.GetSheHe] appreciates my work as [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21013;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. It was a very quick and concise message inquiring about my good health, with a comment about the possibility of the two of us keeping more in contact with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21013;It was very nice of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21013_A;Write back to §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! telling [From.GetHerHim] that you agree with [From.GetHerHis] sentiment and appreciate the thoughtful letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21013;Meaningless words.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21013_B;Crumple the letter and forget about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back, informing me that [From.GetSheHe] is in absolute agreement – good relations are a necessity between rulers as wise as us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back, expressing how touched [From.GetSheHe] was by my wonderful message about peace and friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back, informing me that [From.GetSheHe] has taken notice of my interest in [From.GetHerHis] friendship and reciprocates vividly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21014;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded to my letter. I have to assume that my dispassionate plea for a healthy and prosperous relation between realm did not pierce through [From.GetHerHis] skepticism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded to my letter. How could [From.GetSheHe] not be touched by my poetic plea for friendship?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded to my letter. Perhaps I should have tried writing in a less blunt way...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21015;Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21018;[From.GetFirstName] is really trying [From.GetHerHis] best to impress me. I cannot deny that [From.GetHerHis] recent attempts to win my favor have been more than successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21018;[From.GetFirstName] has shown time and again that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be my friend. After so many shows of courteous behavior, I find myself increasingly obligated to return the favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21018;It is hard to see past the real selfish motivations behind [From.GetFirstName]'s fumbling attempts to gain my favor. Despite [From.GetHerHis] best efforts, I feel no more warming up to [From.GetHerHim] than I would to burned-out candle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP21018;It is hard to see past the real selfish motivations behind [From.GetFirstName]'s fumbling attempts to gain my favor. Far from endearing [From.GetHerHim] to me, [From.GetHerHis] insistence is starting to become quite annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21018;I can really trust people like [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21018;[From.GetSheHeCap] is certainly a good acquaintance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21018;I just wish [From.GetSheHe] would stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21018;I cannot stand this sycophant any longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] have not been in vain. I am slowly but surely winning over the [From.GetManWoman]'s friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] have not been in vain. I am slowly gaining [From.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] were unsuccessful. The [From.GetManWoman] still mistrusts me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] were a complete failure. Far from liking me more, the [From.GetManWoman] is becoming irritated by my very presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21019;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21021;Perhaps it could help me to increase [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s opinion of me if I just sent [From.GetHerHim] a gift as a show of friendship and good faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21021;I will send [From.GetHerHim] a priceless work of art.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP21021;This is not a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21022;I have just received the most delightful work of art from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] sent it to me without expecting anything in return. In the letter accompanying it, [From.GetSheHe] wrote that [From.GetHerHis] only hope is that I appreciate this munificent gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21022;I have just received a very thoughtful gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] sent it to me without expecting anything in return. In the letter accompanying it, [From.GetSheHe] wrote that [From.GetHerHis] only hope is that I appreciate [From.GetHerHis] kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21022;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to send me a small gift as a token of [From.GetHerHis] friendship and good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21022;How thoughtful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21022;This is insulting! I deserve more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21023;It seems I did not spend all that money in vain. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was thrilled by my gift and told me [From.GetSheHe] was struck by my thoughtful gesture. I really made a good impression on [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] received my gift really well. [From.GetSheHeCap] informed me that it was a very kind gesture, one that [From.GetSheHe] will not soon forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21023;Despite my lack of effort, [From.GetTitledFirstName] really appreciated my gift. [From.GetSheHeCap] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will remember my kind gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21023;Good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21024;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent no response after my generous gift. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21024;What a waste of money...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21026;I am sure that, if I use the influence I hold over my tribes to increase [From.GetHerHis] standing, [From.GetTitledFirstName] will come to appreciate me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21026;I will bestow [From.GetHerHim] the greatest honors!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP21026;This is not a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21027;I have heard that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is sparing no compliments when talking about me to [From.GetHerHis] tribesmen. Thanks to [From.GetHerHis] kind words, I am acquiring quite the reputation in [From.GetHerHis] realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21027;I have heard that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is spending a great deal of words talking about my integrity and my honor when talking to [From.GetHerHis] tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21027;I have heard rumors that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has spent a few good words about me when talking to [From.GetHerHis] tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21027;How nice of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21027;How much is [From.GetHerHis] word worth anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21028;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was struck by the stream of honors I have showered [From.GetHerHim] with. I doubt [From.GetSheHe] will soon forget my kind gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21028;It seems that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been truly touched by the honors I bestowed upon [From.GetHerHim]. I am sure [From.GetSheHe] has come to like me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21028;It looks like the few words I spared for [From.GetTitledFirstName] were the only thing that was needed for [From.GetHerHim] to warm up to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21028;Perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21029;My attempts to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName] were not very successful: [From.GetSheHe] has ignored all the good rumors I have spread about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21029;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21031;Perhaps I should use my extensive military knowledge to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName] into liking me more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21031;Let us talk strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21031_A;Make use of your §YMartial§! training in order to §YSway§! §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP21031;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21032;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a very detailed letter dealing with strategic warfare, taking examples from [From.GetHerHis] own studies and personal experiences in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21032;I have heard a lot about [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s military exploits in recent weeks. If even half of them are true, there is no doubt a [From.GetManWoman] of such bravery and brilliance is deserving of anyone's respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21032;I am impressed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21032;Bah, nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21033;My letter was very appreciated it seems: [From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back to thank me for the thoughtful gift, remarking that [From.GetSheHe] will treasure what [From.GetSheHe] has learned from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21033;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to be very impressed by the stories I have spread about my military prowess. [From.GetSheHeCap] has openly praised my bravery and military brilliance, in a clear show of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21033;How could [From.GetSheHe] not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21034;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s response to my letter was cold and hastily written. Whether [From.GetSheHe] is uninterested in military matters, or [From.GetSheHe] doubts the validity of my suggestions, it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] was not impressed by my letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21034;I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] is simply uninterested in these matters or unimpressed with my delivery, but it is certain that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded well to the stories of my military life as well as I had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21034;How could [From.GetSheHe] not be impressed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21036;With my illustrious education in all affairs of state and diplomacy, I should have no trouble finding the right way to endear myself to [From.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21036;I will send an envoy to [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP21036;I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21037;A few envoys from [From.GetTitledFirstName] have come to my court. They explained that their [From.GetTitle] believes having them stay here will help the two of us to maintain better relations with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21037;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a very skillfully written letter to explain [From.GetHerHis] ardent wish to maintain a good relationship between two honorable rulers such as we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21037;Very impressive, I am touched.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21037;It sounds reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21037;Tsk, another sycophant...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21038;Just as expected, my diplomats were able to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of what an honorable and trustworthy ruler I am, a [Root.GetManWoman] that is well worth [From.GetHerHis] respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21038;My words achieved the expected result: [From.GetTitledFirstName] responded to my appeal for unity by telling me that [From.GetSheHe] is in complete agreement with me and wishes only for us to be in good terms with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21038;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21039;Unfortunately, my diplomats were unable to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of my good intentions. I am afraid I will have to try something different to earn [From.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21039;Unfortunately, my letter was unable to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of my good intentions. I am afraid I will have to try something different to earn [From.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21039;There must be other options...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21041;I wonder if [From.GetTitledFirstName] would appreciate learning more about the benefits of hard work from me? I cannot think of anything else right now that would help [From.GetHerHim] like me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21041;I might understand more about money than I do about people, but that doesn't mean I couldn't use my extensive knowledge of my realm's economy to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21041;With my astounding knowledge in all matters of state and stewardship, it should not be too hard to sway [From.GetTitledFirstName] into appreciating me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21041;I will share my knowledge of statesmanship with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP21041;I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21042;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a letter describing in detail the tricks and rules of statesmanship that [From.GetSheHe] has learned during the course of [From.GetHerHis] life, hoping it would endear [From.GetHerHim] to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21042;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to share some of the wealth of [From.GetHerHis] realm with me in a show of good faith, hoping that it would help me trust [From.GetHerHim] more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21042;I have heard great tales of how rich and prosperous [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s realm is as of late. The [From.GetTitle] ruling over such a rich nation must be a very respectable person... provided that any of what I have heard is true, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21042;This letter is extremely interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21042;Impressive indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21042;So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21043;[From.GetTitledFirstName] answered to my letter admitting that [From.GetSheHe] has much to learn from me and has really appreciated me taking some time off my duties as [Root.GetTitle] in order to teach [From.GetHerHim] something about statesmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21043;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has greatly appreciated my offering to [From.GetHerHis] realm. [From.GetSheHeCap] assured me that [From.GetSheHe] will put it to good use and remember my generous act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21043;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have been very impressed by the tales I have spread about my realm's prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21043;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21044;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s answer to my letter was cold and detached. I am unsure whether [From.GetSheHe] is simply uninterested in the subject or [From.GetSheHe] thinks that I have poorly presented it, but [From.GetSheHe] was certainly not impressed by my gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21044;[From.GetTitledFirstName] took my generous offering and did not even thank me! Whether it was because of greed or disdain towards me, my attempt to sway [From.GetHerHim] clearly failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21044;Despite my best efforts to catch [From.GetHerHis] interest, [From.GetTitledFirstName] remains unimpressed with the tales of my prosperous realm. I might have to try something else in order to sway [From.GetHerHim] to my cause...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21044;What a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21046;With the use of my extensive knowledge, I am confident I will be able to sway [From.GetTitledFirstName] into becoming my trusted friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP21046;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21047;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to gift me one of [From.GetHerHis] most prized books, hoping it will help me in my search for knowledge as it helped [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] own endeavors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21047;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me the most thoughtful letter. In it, [From.GetSheHe] explored all the proper rituals of worship that any good [From.Religion.GetName] should follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21047;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wished to inform me that I am free to take as many books as I wish from [From.GetHerHis] library in case I need any for whatever reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21047;I am flattered!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21047;This is very nice of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21047;Books? Pah!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21048;It was not easy separating myself from such a precious book, but my gesture was not in vain. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was quite impressed by my thoughtful gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21048;[From.GetTitledFirstName] received my small essay very positively. [From.GetSheHeCap] wrote me back that [From.GetSheHe] is humbled by gift and that [From.GetSheHe] is eager to test the efficacy of the rituals listed within.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21048;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was happy to be granted limited access to my library and has already taken a few books for [From.GetHerHis] studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21048;It is so rare to find someone who appreciates the value of reading...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21049;I was shocked to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has not even attempted to read the book I gifted [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] might not be interested at all in my present.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21049;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have dismissed my theological essay without much thought. I truly hoped that [From.GetSheHe] would be more interested in the matters of faith...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21049;[From.GetTitledFirstName] politely refused my offering to lend [From.GetHerHim] some of my books. It appears that [From.GetSheHe] is not really interested in studying from my library.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21049;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21051;I am thinking of a good way to sway [From.GetTitledFirstName] into liking me a bit more. What could possibly titillate the senses of a [From.GetManWoman] like [From.GetHerHim], I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21051;I am feeling inspired today...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP21051;This doesn't sound like a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21052;I have just received the most depraved letter I have ever read. Under the use of clever metaphors and impeccable style, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has hidden some of the most grotesque and strangely alluring activities performed by man.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21052;I was somewhat surprised to be approached by a group of high-class courtesans during a nightly fair. They claim to be a gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21052;I was beyond surprised to discover that [From.GetTitledFirstName] was waiting for me outside the hall of my [Root.GetHouse], ready to sneak [From.GetHerHis] arm under mine and propose in a whisper that we went for a walk in the garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21052;What an unexpected visit!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21052;Not bad, not bad at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21052;This isn't really in my taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21052;Ugh! This is repulsive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21053;I received a response from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. In the letter, [From.GetSheHe] wrote of how much [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed reading the poetic masterpiece that I created for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21053;At least according to the reports of the group of prostitutes, [From.GetTitledFirstName] was extremely satisfied by my present. I suppose I will have to take them on their word.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21053;As I sneak out of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s bed in the morning, I cannot fail to notice the satisfied smirk on [From.GetHerHis] sleeping face, a clear sign that my gift was quite appreciated by the [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21053;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21054;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate my gift for whatever reason. I guess I will have to try thinking about some other way to tease [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21054;Not only [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate my gift, [From.GetSheHe] wished to make it expressly clear that [From.GetSheHe] found the very notion of it repulsive, and wished for such subjects to never be brought up ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21054;How boring of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21056;Surely, the way to get to [From.GetFirstName]'s heart is through [From.GetHerHis] stomach. Maybe I should have something prepared for [From.GetHerHim] as a way to draw us closer to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP21057;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to share some of the exotic food [From.GetSheHe] has discovered in [From.GetHerHis] many years of epicurean adventures. The packaged goods look quite fresh and extremely inviting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21057;[From.GetTitledFirstName] invited me to a formal dinner with [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is well-known for [From.GetHerHis] lavish feasts and exotic foods, so this might be a very enjoyable experience for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21057;I am happy to partake!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21057;Not bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21057;I am not one for food, sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21057;All of this love for excess is shameful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21058;I was happy to know that my offer yielded positive results. Not only has [From.GetFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] has very much appreciated my food, [From.GetSheHe] cannot wait for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21058;I was happy to know that my offer yielded positive results. [From.GetFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] has very much appreciated my food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21058;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21059;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not impressed by my offering of food. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is simply not one to enjoy eating as much as I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21059;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was repulsed by my offering of food. Perhaps I chose the wrong approach to win [From.GetHerHim] over...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21059;More for me, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP21061;Thinking new ways to make [From.GetTitledFirstName] like me more is hurting my brain, and yet, for as much as I hate exhausting myself, something needs to be done if I ever wish [From.GetHerHim] to be my friend...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21061;I could... invite [From.GetHerHim] here for sightseeing?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP21062;[From.GetTitledFirstName] invited me to spend an afternoon at [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse], sightseeing. It wasn't a very lively experience, we barely even talked, but it was strangely soothing looking at the horizon for a few hours together...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21062;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Chancellor sent me a very polite letter inquiring about my health and good fortune. [localized_chancellor.GetSheHeCap] hopes that the two of us can learn more about each other in the future and improve our relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21062;This was surprisingly nice! Thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21062;I appreciate the gesture at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21062;What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21062_A;How can a [From.GetManWoman] be so lazy?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21062_B;[From.GetSheHeCap] didn't even dictate it *[From.GetHerselfHimself]*!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21063;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has really appreciated my kind gesture, far more than I could have hoped for. I guess this is just further proof that I do not need to overexert myself in order to achieve excellent results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21063;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was glad of my thoughtful gesture. I think I have earned a good rest after all the hard work I have had to put myself through.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21063;The things I do for friendship...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21064;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not too impressed by my act of friendship. Perhaps I should have put a little more effort into it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21064;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not too impressed by my act of friendship. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] openly stated that [From.GetSheHe] was insulted by the complete lack of effort I have shown in my attempt to sway [From.GetHerHim] to my cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21064;But I worked so much, really!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21066;[From.GetTitledFirstName] still resists my attempts to establish a solid relationship between us. It is quite infuriating. I wonder what I could do to make [From.GetHerHim] come to [From.GetHerHis] senses faster...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21066;A very concise letter will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP21066;I cannot be bothered with this right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21067;I just received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. In it, the [From.GetTitle] describes the virtues of quick thinking and resolute action. It is an interesting read to be sure, albeit very short.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21067;I was very surprised when, during our brief encounter this morning, [From.GetTitledFirstName] demanded that I stop my allegedly noncommittal relation with [From.GetHerHim] and openly admit my support for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21067_A;Brief and to the point: I like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21067_B;I guess so?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21067;What is [From.GetSheHe] rambling about?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21067;Insulting! What is [From.GetSheHe] insinuating?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21068;Just as expected, my letter was well received by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has written me a short message in response to congratulate me for my wisdom and foresight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21068;Just as expected, [From.GetTitledFirstName] only needed me to rough [From.GetHerHim] up a bit in order to openly admit how well we get along with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21068;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21069;Despite my attempts to solicit a clear response from [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] remains uneasy around me. I wonder what could be the cause...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21069;My attempt to solicit a clear response from [From.GetTitledFirstName] were not well received. It appears I am too loud and direct for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s tastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21069;Bah! Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21071;It is so hard to think about what I could do to endear [From.GetTitledFirstName] to me. I am already so perfect, after all. Why would anyone need encouragement in order to enjoy the pleasure of being in my good graces?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21071;I will write [From.GetHerHim] a letter about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21071_A;Send a letter to §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!, writing about how lucky [From.GetSheHe] is to have a friend like you. Hopefully this will §YSway§! [From.GetHerHim] to your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP21071;I have no time for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21072;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. In it, [From.GetSheHe] espouses all of [From.GetHerHis] supposed virtues, and suggests that any [Root.GetTitle] would die to receive all of this attention from [From.GetHerHim] as I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21072;The most curious gift arrived today at court. [From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a statue of [From.GetHerHim], along with [From.GetHerHis] best wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21072;That's very impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21072;I suppose [From.GetSheHe] deserves it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21072;That's a bit too self-serving for my tastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21072;Who does [From.GetSheHe] thinks [From.GetSheHe] is?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21073;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has showered me with justly-earned praise after the kindness I did to [From.GetHerHim]. There is no doubt [From.GetSheHe] has been struck by my show of prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21073;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] is very flattered by the attention I have given [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] hopes to remain within my good graces for longer still.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21073;How gracious of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21074;How peculiar... [From.GetTitledFirstName] was not impressed by my generous gift. Has my splendor reached such magnitude that common people are too blinded by it to recognize what it is?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21074;Insulting! [From.GetTitledFirstName] had the audacity to claim that I am too full of myself! And right after I so generously expressed my friendship towards [From.GetHerHim] too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21074;[From.GetSheHeCap] just doesn't understand me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21076;I know that there must be a way to earn [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s trust, and the best way to learn it is without a doubt talking to [From.GetHerHim]. But about what?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21076;I really hope [From.GetTitledFirstName] is doing well. I wonder if there could be something else I could do for [From.GetHerHim] to help [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] endeavors...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21076;I will simply ask [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP21077;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a letter expressing [From.GetHerHis] fervent desire to know me better, so that we can come to be good acquaintances. If nothing else, it was a thoughtful and kind gesture from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21077;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a letter inquiring about my good health. [From.GetSheHe] says that [From.GetSheHe] is worried about me and wishes to know that I am well, or, in case something is wrong with me, [From.GetSheHe] assures me that [From.GetSheHe] will do whatever is in [From.GetHerHis] power to aid me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21077;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a letter inquiring about my religion. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to have a genuine interest in knowing more about what it is like being a [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21077_A;Sure! I am happy to talk to [From.GetHerHim] about me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP21077_B;None of [From.GetHerHis] business.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21077_C;A [From.Religion.GetName] would never understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was more than happy to talk to me about [From.GetHerHis] struggles and aspirations. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] seems to have questions for me as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was really touched by my concern and assured me that I will be the first to receive news about [From.GetHerHis] health, for better or worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was happy to tell me more about the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, while also not sparing a few questions for me about being a [Root.Religion.GetName]. We ended up having a very interesting theological discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21078;This is wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21079;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was unmoved by my concern for [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claimed that we do not know each other well enough to reveal details about [From.GetHerHis] personal life to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21079;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was unmoved by my concern for [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claimed that [From.GetHerHis] health is [From.GetHerHis] concern only.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21079;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was unmoved by my concern for [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claimed that there is no point for [From.GetHerHim] to talk about [From.GetHerHis] faith to an unbeliever.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21079;Disgraceful...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21081;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the Physician sent to me by [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], was very thorough in [From.GetHerHis] treatment. I feel a lot better now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21081;Marvelous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21082;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the Physician sent to me by [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], was not as bad as I feared: [From.GetSheHe] didn't do much, but I still feel a bit better after [From.GetHerHis] visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21082;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21083;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the Physician sent to me by [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], was not as good as I hoped. In fact, I fear [From.GetHerHis] treatment has worsened my condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21083;That charlatan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21085;What can I possibly do to endear [From.GetTitledFirstName] to me? I am not particularly experienced in making people like me, but it cannot be *that* hard...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP21085;I don't have time for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21086;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me an envelope containing the rotten head of some no-name bard who, allegedly, was writing songs mocking me. Judging by the message sticking from the bard's mouth, [From.GetTitledFirstName] apparently thinks this gruesome gift will make me like [From.GetHerHim] more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21086;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a long letter detailing all the repulsive and horrifying ways [From.GetSheHe] punishes [From.GetHerHis] enemies, telling me it could help me learn to deal with my own detractors. [From.GetTitledFirstName] apparently thinks this gruesome gift will make me like [From.GetHerHim] more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21086;And [From.GetSheHe] is right! How delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21086;Thanks, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21086;This is a bit too distasteful...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21086;This is horrible! [From.GetSheHe] is crazy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21087;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back to inform me of how much [From.GetSheHe] has loved my gift. [From.GetSheHeCap] cannot wait to repay [From.GetHerHis] debt by sending me something terrible of [From.GetHerHis] own making.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21087;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seemed to have been put a bit off by my thoughtful present. Nevertheless, [From.GetSheHe] thanked me for taking the time to prepare it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21087;How nice of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21088;Despite all the care that I put in preparing [From.GetHerHis] gift, [From.GetTitledFirstName] claimed that [From.GetSheHe] would have preferred if I limited myself to a simple letter wishing [From.GetHerHim] good health.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21088;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have completely missed the point of my present. For whatever absurd reason, [From.GetSheHe] thinks that its purpose was to scare [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21088;Why would I ever do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21090;I have always been better at talking through my pen. Maybe the best way to show my good intentions towards [From.GetTitledFirstName] is to dedicate [From.GetHerHim] a poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21090_A;I will write about how fair [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP21091;Is [From.GetSheHe] trying to make a fool of me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21092;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was thoroughly impressed by my poem and openly stated that I must be the best living writer in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to be able to write such beautiful rhymes about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21092;While not exactly teeming with excitement, [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have taken the poem I have dedicated to [From.GetHerHim] fairly well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21092;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21093;How unfortunate. After all the time I spent writing it, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not even like my poem about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21093;Far from liking my poem about [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] was in fact insulted by it. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks I am trying to mock [From.GetHerHim] with my work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21093;What a sad little [From.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21094;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has spent quite some time trying to befriend me, yet now we both find ourselves on the opposite sides of the battlefield. While honor compels me to fight for my liege, I feel an obligation towards [From.GetTitledFirstName] as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP21095;I cannot deny [From.GetHerHis] reasons...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21095;The traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21096;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to set aside [From.GetHerHis] sword and proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] refuses to fight any longer for [From.GetHerHis] liege in a war against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21096;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to abandon [From.GetHerHis] liege, committing treason rather than risk fighting against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWHFP20606;I take a deep breath and move my eyes from the half-finished dish on my table to my distended, aching stomach.

EVTDESCHFPA20041;My husband [scoped_spouse.GetFirstName] has been so patient with me, carefully listening to all the rambling I have been doing in these last weeks... I have never felt so close to him before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20041;I think I am in love!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20042;My wife has spent as much time with me as possible in the past week, constantly talking about the strangest subjects. I was worried at first, but now I am starting to enjoy our long conversations in a way I did not thought possible...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20042;Am I falling in love with her?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20042;It is but a passing fancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20043;With my wife [From.GetFirstName] pregnant, I am starting to worry if I shouldn't organize something special for this year's harvest rite. Pleasing [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] could be instrumental to ensure the birth of a healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP20043;No need to waste money on old superstitions...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20044;I was relieved to hear that [From.GetFirstName] decided to make a huge sacrifice during the seasonal festivity made to honor [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] this year, hoping it would help me deliver a strong child with little complications.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20044;I am sure the goddess will protect me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20045;[From.GetFirstName] has really gone out of his way to ensure that both our child and I receive the favor of the gods. He has personally organized this year's harvest festival, and elected me to portray [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] herself during the celebration, hoping it will help me deliver a strong, healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20045;I am so excited!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20045;I am truly flattered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20045;I am humbled by this honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20046;I place the baby back in the arms of the peasant woman and give her a warm smile as she thanks me for the blessing and gives space to the next petitioner. Acting on behalf of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] for this short time has truly made me understand how I could become a better [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20046;I must talk more often with my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20046;As a mother is to her children, I must be to my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20046;I must be a more exemplar worshiper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20047;Wearing the symbols of divinity, looking at all the hopeful and awestruck faces of the petitioners come to take [Root.GetFertilityGoddess]'s blessing through me... It would be an overwhelming responsibility, if I didn't feel the touch of the goddess upon me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20047;I am truly special!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20047;Could I be her own descendant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20047;No mother was ever as honored as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20048;This festival was no mere coincidence. I can feel the goddess' power coursing through my veins as I administer my blessings to the crowd of petitioners from [Root.Capital.GetName]. I must really be a descendant of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20048;I am a goddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20049;Being carried around town, administering blessings on behalf of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess], is not as relaxing or satisfying as I hoped, but the people are loving this year's festival. They are always excited to see me smile at them and hold up their children.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20049;Simple souls are easily impressed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20050;Another noble guest bows his head at me, giving me his best wishes as my litter is moved through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. I never realized how many of my vassals are devout followers of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess].

EVTDESCHFPA20051;This year, [From.GetTitledFirstName] was elected to represent [From.GetFertilityGoddess] during the harvest festival. The [From.GetTitle] has really risen up to the task, sharing her motherly love with all her subjects and ensuring prosperity to the land and cattle through her blessings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20051;She is such a pious woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20052;Portraying [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] during the harvest festival is a very enjoyable experience. An entire crowd of petitioners has come to my [Root.GetHouse] to get my blessing. They all shower me with words of gratitude, many of them have even brought sweets and cider to serve as small offerings to the goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20052;Refusing to eat would be blasphemous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20052;My throat does get hoarse with all these blessings...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20053;As I administer another blessing, wearing [Root.GetFertilityGoddess]'s regalia, I wonder... If she is the goddess of life and fertility, how can she also be portrayed as virtuous? Is the drive that allows her to bring life to the world more important than her demeanor?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20053;Virtue takes precedence, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20053;She inspired lust in all of us so we could create life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20054;My wife was thrilled to take the role of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] for the festival.

I am not sure this is a [FromFrom.GetManWoman] I can trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFI20410;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] gives me a polite smile and kneels down, passionately reciting [FromFrom.GetHerHis] oath of vassalage and declaring [FromFrom.GetHerHis] hope for my reign to endure for many more years still. It is so rare to meet such a dispassionate and kind person...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFL20410;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] kneels down and recites [FromFrom.GetHerHis] oath, ready to receive my blessing and return to rule [FromFrom.GetHerHis] demesne in my name. The ceremony is quickly over, and my new vassal is soon ready to take [FromFrom.GetHerHis] leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20410;We can play together!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF20410_A;Offer §Y[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]§! to become one of your playmates.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20410;You are no doubt the prettiest face in this court...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF20410;Is this how you present yourself to your [Root.GetTitle]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF20410_C;Mock §Y[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]§!, potentially shaming [FromFrom.GetHerHim] into submission.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20410;We are glad for your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF20410_D;Formally acknowledge §Y[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! oath, maintaining the proper formality dictated by your rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF20410;I am happy you came!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF20410_E;Thank §Y[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]§! for visiting you, using a more informal tone to address [FromFrom.GetHerHim] despite your difference in rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20411;As I kneel down to recite the words, I cannot stop myself from wondering why do I need to partake in this silly ritual when I am not even a [From.Religion.GetName].[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20411;I kneel down to the child [From.GetTitle], peeking every once in a while to make sure that [From.GetSheHe] is still listening to my oath. I never realized that my liege was such a young [From.GetBoyGirl]...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20411;I kneel down to the old [From.GetTitle], peeking every once in a while to make sure that [From.GetSheHe] has not passed out in the middle of my oath. I never realized my liege was such an old [From.GetManWoman]...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFD20411;I can barely take my eyes off [From.GetTitledFirstName] as I recite my oath of vassalage. I did not imagine my liege could be such a charming man...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFDD20411;I can barely take my eyes off [From.GetTitledFirstName] as I recite my oath of vassalage. I did not imagine my liege could be such a beautiful woman...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFF20411;I keep my eyes firmly on the ground as I recite my oath of vassalage to [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The mere sight of my liege's face repulses me.[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFG20411;I cannot hide some of my curiosity examining [From.GetTitledFirstName] as I recite my oath to [From.GetHerHim]. It is not often that a [From.GetManWoman] becomes [From.GetTitle] in these lands...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFH20411;I can barely withstand [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s cold gaze as I recite my oath. There is something truly unsettling about this [From.GetManWoman]...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFI20411;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gives me an encouraging smile as I rise after reciting my oath. I was doubtful at first, but my new liege really does live up to [From.GetHerHis] reputation  as a kind [From.GetTitle].[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFL20411;[From.GetTitledFirstName] waits in silence until I finished reciting my oath of vassalage, then [From.GetSheHe] gestures me to rise. [Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20411_A;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a true [From.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20411_B;It is not my place to judge my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20411_A;I am not sure about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20411_B;There are still limits to our contract!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20412;I seem to have made a very positive impression on [From.GetTitledFirstName]. I am hopeful that, after this ceremony, we will be able to maintain a good and healthy relationship as any liege should with [Root.GetHerHis] vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20412;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] willing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20413;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look too pleased by my response to [From.GetHerHis] oath. Hopefully my behavior did not irredeemably ruin our relationship...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF20413;What did I say wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_homage_play_success; And I was far happier to hear that [From.GetFirstName] wants me to be one of [From.GetHerHis] playmates!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_homage_play_failure; And I was a bit scared when [From.GetFirstName] ordered to remain with [From.GetHerHim] to play games.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_homage_seduce_success; And I was quite pleased to see [From.GetTitledFirstName] lingering over my features with craving eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_homage_seduce_failure; And I was not able to ignore [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s lecherous eyes examining me for the entire duration of the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_homage_mock_success; And when [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to mock me for my poor conditions, I felt incredibly ashamed with myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_homage_mock_failure; And I was beyond furious when [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to mock me for not presenting myself in good enough conditions for [From.GetHerHis] standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_homage_formal_success; And I was pleased to receive [From.GetTitledFirstName] formal blessing and permission to return to my demesne as soon as the ceremony was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

string_homage_informal_success; And I was glad [From.GetTitledFirstName] treated me with respect and a friendly attitude, almost as if we were equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP21098;Perhaps it is time I invited [From.GetTitledFirstName] to spend some time with me. It is probably the fastest way for me to gain [From.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21098;I will ask [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21098_A;Invite §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to come to your [Root.GetHouse] to spend some time with you, hoping it will §YSway§! [From.GetHerHim] to your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21098;The time is not right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21099;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been very insistent about spending some time with me recently. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that we will be on better term if only we take a few days to know each other better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21099;Sounds like a marvelous idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21099_A;Spend a week with §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21099;I do not have time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21099_B;Politely decline §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21100;[From.GetFirstName] was happy to oblige me. Now that I have some time to spend with [From.GetHerHim], I am confident that I can convince [From.GetHerHim] of how alike we are and that [From.GetSheHe] stands only to gain from our friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21100;We can finally talk in private!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_21100_A;Spend a few days with §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! trying to convince your guest of your good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21101;Unfortunately [From.GetTitledFirstName] was not interested in my proposal and politely declined my invitation to spend some time with me at my [Root.GetHouse].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21101;What a disappointment...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21102;I am no stranger to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s [From.GetHouse], but spending such a long period of time with my [GetFromRelation] is not something I am accustomed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21102;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has prepared a grandiose welcoming parade for my arrival. The [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] greets me in person as soon as I cross the gates of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse], asking me if I had a good travel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21102;How nice to meet you, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA21104;It was nice finally being with [sway_target.GetFirstName] for a while. Even though [sway_target.GetSheHe] is my [sway_target.GetRootRelation], my duties as [Root.GetTitle] often prevent me from spending enough time with my own family...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB21104;It is surprising how often [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I found ourselves debating theology during the visit. I suppose it was inevitable when two people of wildly different beliefs spend such a long period of time together...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC21104;I have tried to be a model host to [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName], encouraging [sway_target.GetHerHim] to explore some of the sublime delights I have discovered in my many years of searching for the ultimate pleasure. If nothing else, [sway_target.GetSheHe] looks impressed by my art collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD21104;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I spent countless hours trying to best each other in all sorts of war games during the time of [sway_target.GetHerHis] visit. I tried not to be too competitive and let [sway_target.GetSheHe] win a few games, and by the end of the week [sway_target.GetSheHe] seemed eager to play more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPE21104;After a week of mingling, I have managed to introduce [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to every notable person at court. Each night we feasted together in the main hall, talking about the latest news and listening to the newest songs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPF21104;I took the opportunity of [sway_target.GetFirstName]'s visit to show [sway_target.GetHerHim] my private study and some of my experiments. For hours I described [sway_target.GetHerHim] the fruits of my many years of labor, hoping to catch [sway_target.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPG21104;Having the opportunity to spend a few days with [sway_target.GetFirstName] allowed me to show [sway_target.GetHerHim] all the wondrous books I have gathered in my library. We have spent countless hours reading through ancient texts and talking about the most intriguing subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPH21104;I think these days have really helped me getting [sway_target.GetFirstName] to know and appreciate me better. We have passed most of our time in my [Root.GetHouse], discussing of the most disparate topics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPI21104;I have brought [sway_target.GetFirstName] to one of my famous, great hunts for the duration of [sway_target.GetHerHis] visit, hoping to impress my guest by sharing some of my experience with [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPII21104;I organized the visit to my aviary to be the climatic moment of [sway_target.GetFirstName]'s visit at my [Root.GetHouse]. I showed [sway_target.GetHerHim] some of my more impressive and prized hawks and even taught [sway_target.GetHerHim] a few tricks about falconry, hoping it would help me gain the trust of my guest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPL21104;[sway_target.GetFirstName] and I spent most of our afternoons in [Root.Capital.GetName] walking through my beautiful garden. We talked of the most disparate subjects while exploring the little corner of paradise I have carefully crafted during my years of botanical care.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPM21104;While [sway_target.GetFirstName] was my guest, I could not stop myself from sharing with [sway_target.GetHerHim] stories of my most exceptional duels, hoping to impress [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPN21104;I have taken the opportunity to have [sway_target.GetFirstName] explore [Root.Capital.GetName] during [sway_target.GetHerHis] visit. Together we examined some of the marvels of architecture that make my capital the greatest city in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPO21104;I think these days have really helped me getting [sway_target.GetFirstName] to know and appreciate me better. We have spent most of our time visiting my demesne, discussing of the most disparate topics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_A;I am really glad I could spend some time with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_B;I hope these debates helped us understanding and accepting our differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_C;My [Root.GetHouse] was enriched by your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_D;It was truly an honor to have you here for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTQHFP21104_PROUD;I am sure you enjoyed being in my presence for so long.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_AMBITIOUS;Planning your visit filled me with purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_ARBITRARY;Surely you appreciated having such a liberal host...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_BRAVE;Only a few words need be exchanged between honorable rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_CONTENT;I was happy to have you here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_CRAVEN;I hope you felt safe enough in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_CRUEL;I am sure you enjoyed the visit to my torture chamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_CYNICAL;Hopefully you enjoyed being far from preachers for once.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_DECEITFUL;I wonder if [From.GetSheHe] knows my true intentions...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_ERUDITE;I hope you appreciated my book collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_GREGARIOUS;It was good meeting a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_HONEST;I hope we can trust each other more now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_JUST;I fulfilled all my obligations as a host.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTQHFP21104_SHY;...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_STUBBORN;And one last thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_TRUSTING;You really look like a trustworthy [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQHFP21104_ZEALOUS;I have truly been a model [Root.Religion.GetName] host.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHFP21104_A;I hope you liked your time here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21105;[Root.GetSwayVisitIntro] [Root.GetSwayVisitOutro];;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_relative;My [GetFromRelation] was a very kind host, spending most of these past days trying to catch up with what has happened in my life in the past few years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_religion;[From.GetFirstName] and I found ourselves talking about religion for a surprising number of times during my stay, in the most respectable terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_inside_hedonist;[From.GetFirstName] organized the most lavish celebrations for my visit. Day and night, [From.GetSheHe] subjected me to an uninterrupted barrage of feasting and entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_inside_gamer;[From.GetFirstName] hosted me for a few days, spending entire afternoons entertaining me with [From.GetHerHis] exotic strategy games.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_inside_socializer;[From.GetFirstName] hosted me for nearly a week, introducing me to all the newest, most important members of [From.GetHerHis] court, and being all-around amicable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_inside_mystic;[From.GetFirstName] hosted me for nearly a week, but I saw very little of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse] outside of [From.GetHerHis] small alchemical study.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_inside_scholar;[From.GetFirstName] hosted me for nearly a week, but I saw very little of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse] outside of [From.GetHerHis] large library.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_inside_default;[From.GetFirstName] hosted me for nearly a week, entertaining me with stories about [From.GetHerHis] recent deeds and organizing a few luxurious feasts in my honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_outside_hunter;[From.GetFirstName] hosted me for nearly a week, but we barely spent any time at court. Most of our days we roamed for the countryside, hunting in the [From.GetTitle]'s forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_outside_falconer;[From.GetFirstName] is truly attached to [From.GetHerHis] birds. [From.GetSheHe] spent an entire day of my visit just to show me [From.GetHerHis] most prized hawks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_outside_gardener;Most of my visit to [From.GetFirstName] was spent in my host's garden: a truly amazing construction to behold, [From.GetFirstName] must have spent years creating it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_outside_duelist;During my long visit, [From.GetFirstName] entertained me with many stories about [From.GetHerHis] past fights, describing all actions in great detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_outside_architect;During my long visit, [From.GetFirstName] showed me some of the amazing architectural wonders in [From.Capital.GetName] whose construction [From.GetSheHe] has overseen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_outside_default;During my long visit, [From.GetFirstName] guided me throughout [From.GetHerHis] demesne. We explored the countryside and some of the most breathtaking sights that [From.Capital.GetName] can offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_swayed_3;I never realized [From.GetFirstName] and I had so much in common...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_swayed_2;Most of all, my host certainly proved [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a great talker.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_swayed_1;I undoubtedly felt welcome by my host's attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_swayed_0;It was an overall pleasant experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_appease_visit_failure_1;Yet, I simply couldn't get over some of my host's most annoying quirks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21105;This was surely an interesting experience...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21106;While I invited [From.GetFirstName] to my court primarily to endear [From.GetHerHim] to my cause, I have found myself becoming very fond of [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21106;We have so much in common!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21106;It doesn't matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21107;Visiting [From.GetFirstName] has really opened my eyes. I have become really fond of [From.GetHerHim], enough to call [From.GetHerHim] a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21107;And I am [From.GetHerHis] friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21107;And yet, I should keep my distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21108;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to politely refuse my offer of friendship. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs some time to learn to trust me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21108;Maybe another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21109;While I invited [From.GetFirstName] to my court primarily to endear [From.GetHerHim] to my cause, I have found myself becoming really fond of [From.GetHerHim] after spending this time with [From.GetHerHim], going even beyond the bonds of simple friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21109;I love [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21109;I shouldn't lose my mind over [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21110;Being with [From.GetFirstName] in these past days has changed my perspective on [From.GetHerHim] entirely. I have become really attached to [From.GetHerHim], even beyond the limits of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21110;I must be in love with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21110;It is only a passing fancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21111;Unfortunately, it appears that [From.GetFirstName] does not share my feelings for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21111;What a shame...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21113;Visiting [From.GetFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] library has made me develop a love for book and literary studies that I did not thought possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21113;Visiting [From.GetFirstName] and learning about [From.GetHerHis] occult studies has made me develop a eerily curiosity for the dark matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21113;[From.GetFirstName] was a wonderful host during my visit, cordial and cheerful. I wonder if I also could improve my own attitude by taking on some of [From.GetHerHis] mannerism when dealing with my guests...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP21113;Even now that I am back home, my mind is still filled with strategies and scores from my games with [From.GetFirstName]. Visiting [From.GetHerHim] awakened in me a love for boardgames that I did not know I had.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHFP21113;Life at [Root.Capital.GetName] looks tame and dreary after participating to [From.GetFirstName]'s great hunt. I never knew I could develop such an interest for this sort of activity, yet now I long to immerse myself in the wilderness once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFHFP21113;Looking at the pride and rewarding bond between [From.GetFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] hawks has opened my mind about falconry. Perhaps I should try my hand at it as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHFP21113;[From.GetFirstName]'s garden is the envy of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse], and, after exploring it in person, I can clearly see why. I wonder if I could outdo [From.GetHerHim] with a garden of my own...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHFP21113;Stories about [From.GetFirstName]'s battle exploits have awakened new desires in me. I have found myself increasingly bored by my quiet life, and more drawn towards riskier and more exciting activities...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHFP21113;During my visit to [From.Capital.GetName] I could not deny my envy for some of the architectural marvels born out of [From.GetFirstName]'s imagination. I wonder if I could follow [From.GetHerHis] example and build some monuments of my own...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLHFP21113;During my stay, [From.GetFirstName] introduced me to new and unbelievable heights of pleasure and sublime, delectable experiences. Now that I am back to [Root.Capital.GetName], I have found myself longing for another taste of [From.GetHerHis] hedonistic life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21113;I wish to make [From.GetFirstName]'s lifestyle my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21113;It would be only a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21114;I have just discovered that, after my visit, [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to adopt my own lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21114;I must really have impressed [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21115;Despite any difference that we might have, I cannot deny [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was extremely gracious as a host, to the point that I now feel indebted to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] after my visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21115;I owe [FromFrom.GetHerHim] a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21115;Being a good host was just [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21116;[From.GetFirstName] was so struck by my generosity and kindness as a host that, just before departing, [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] now feels indebted with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21116;How kind of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21117;I tried my best to be conciliatory with [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName], but we simply couldn't come to an agreement about [FromFrom.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21117;Surely, we can find common ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21117;I must endeavor to be patient and concede [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] points.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21117;We must agree to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP21117;NO! *You* are wrong!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21118;My visit was not up to a good start when [From.GetFirstName] and I had a strong disagreement about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. Fortunately, my host was able to deescalate the fight, and apologized.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21118;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21119;My visit was not up to a good start when [From.GetFirstName] and I had a strong disagreement about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21119;At least [From.GetSheHe] was patient enough to hear my case.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21120;Unfortunately, most of my visit to [From.GetFirstName] devolved into petty fighting about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21120;We must agree to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21121;My visit was not up to a good start when [From.GetFirstName] and I had a strong disagreement about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. Even worse, my host was completely unable to see my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21121;This is insulting!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21123;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I have grown too far apart. It is very unlikely [From.GetSheHe] will ever respond positively to my attempts to sway [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP21124_CHASTE;Talking so much with a chaste person such as [From.GetTitledFirstName] has started to make me question if I should put a stop to my libertine ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_TEMPERATE;Being forced to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s frugal meals was a little unbearable at first, but now that I am back home I wonder if it wouldn't be best for my health to adopt [From.GetHerHis] diet...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CHARITABLE;I was truly struck by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s generosity during my visit, and by the joy and prestige it brought [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps I should endeavor to be more charitable myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_DILIGENT;Witnessing how much [From.GetTitledFirstName] is able to do in a single day and the satisfaction on [From.GetHerHis] face after a job well done left a strange impression on me. Maybe I should strive to be more diligent in my own duties...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_PATIENT;Seeing how patient and responsible [From.GetTitledFirstName] was during our time together amazed me. Can a person really be so calm even in the face of adversity?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_KIND;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s kind and gentle spirit were a baffling thing to experience during my visit, yet I cannot deny that the warmth [From.GetSheHe] received from [From.GetHerHis] subjects because of [From.GetHerHis] kindness was strangely alluring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_HUMBLE;I always thought diminishing one's achievements was a sign of weakness, but, after witnessing [From.GetFirstName]'s behavior during my visit at [From.Capital.GetName], and seeing how positively [From.GetHerHis] humble demeanor is received by [From.GetHerHis] subjects, I wonder if I should strive to imitate [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_LUSTFUL;All throughout my visit to [From.Capital.GetName] I could scarcely believe how liberally my host satisfied [From.GetHerHis] lust, without as much as a scolding look from [From.GetHerHis] subjects or peers. Maybe I am holding myself to a higher standard than I should...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_GLUTTONOUS;[From.GetTitledFirstName] subjected me to all sorts of delicacies and lavish feasts during my visit. Now that I am back home, I am finding myself still craving for more than what my frugal diet can offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_GREEDY;Until a few weeks ago, I was sure that my duties as a [Root.GetTitle] bound me to show a certain amount of generosity towards all my subjects, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] showed me that there might be some virtue in parsimony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_SLOTHFUL;Seeing how calm and relaxed [From.GetTitledFirstName] was for the entire duration of my visit is making me wonder if I am taking my duties as [Root.GetTitle] too seriously...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_WROTH;Reflecting upon my time spent with [From.GetTitledFirstName] and how respected [From.GetSheHe] is by [From.GetHerHis] subjects, I am starting to think that, being so calm and submissive might be the reason why some of my peers and vassals are so reticent to obey to my orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP21124_AMBITIOUS;I have been thinking about [From.GetTitledFirstName] as of late, and of all the feats that [From.GetHerHis] tenacious spirit has allowed [From.GetHerHim] to accomplish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_ARBITRARY;Talking for so long with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has allowed me to reflect a lot upon the nature of law and honor. Maybe there are some instances where I am too strict with my judgment...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_BRAVE;My visit to [From.Capital.GetName] was a true inspiration for me. Witnessing how brazenly [From.GetTitledFirstName] faces any danger has forced me to look in shame at my own cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CONTENT;Seeing how peaceful and happy [From.GetTitledFirstName] is during my visit to [From.Capital.GetName] made me wonder if, in my search for glory, I am simply wasting my life in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CRAVEN;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has really opened my eyes regarding the many dangers of this world. Perhaps I ought to be more careful with my life...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CYNICAL;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] for so long has deeply shaken my faith in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is right, perhaps there is nothing waiting for us beyond death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_DECEITFUL;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has opened my eyes to how easily people can be manipulated by using the right words. It might not be an honest attitude, but it seems to serve [From.GetHerHim] well to avoid conflicts and be a successful [From.GetTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_GREGARIOUS;During my visit I couldn't believe how comfortable my host was when talking with me as well as with all of [From.GetHerHis] other courtiers, and what positive effect [From.GetHerHis] welcoming attitude had on the entire court...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_HONEST;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] during my visit to [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse] has brought me to question my lack of honesty. Lying has always been a convenient solution to many of my problems, but is it worth the taint upon my reputation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_JUST;Talking for so long with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has allowed me to reflect a lot upon the nature of law and honor. Maybe my lack of coherence when exacting judgment is negatively affecting my realm more than I originally believed or than should I tolerate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_PARANOID;Even now that I am back home, the worries instilled by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s paranoid ramblings still torment me. Perhaps I am too trusting, perhaps there are indeed enemies hiding amongst my friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_SHY;Seeing how [From.GetTitledFirstName] reacted to my open and friendly demeanor has brought me to question my character. Maybe it is inappropriate for a [Root.GetTitle] like me to act in such an open and informal manner with my subjects and peers...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_TRUSTING;During my visit at [From.Capital.GetName], I was initially surprised by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s trusting nature, but, now that I am back home, I found myself longing for that sense of safety and peace that I saw in my host's eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_ZEALOUS;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has awakened a new fervor in my heart. Maybe my attitude towards [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] was too dismissive...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21124;I should be more like [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21124;Bah! Nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP20676;Studying my liege's frail condition has brought me to believe that [From.GetHerHis] lack of appetite and sleep may be caused by a severe unbalance of [From.GetHerHis] humors. Operating periodic leeching sessions on [From.GetHerHim] might be what [From.GetSheHe] needs in order to get back in shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20676;I will suggest the treatment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20676;Maybe I am wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20677;My Physician has informed me that periodic leeching might be what I need to restore my appetite and facilitate my sleep at night. Perhaps I should try this treatment...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20677;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20677;I am not submitting myself to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20701;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was thrilled to test my treatment. We immediately operated the first of many bloodlettings to come, and I am hopeful that, through this process, my liege will soon find [From.GetHerHis] balance once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20701;It is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20702;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not interested in my proposal. I can do nothing else to help [From.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20702;Such a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20678;All this bloodletting might not have helped me get back in strength, but it is undoubtedly affecting my humoral balance. While I see some things more clearly, I feel like I am growing colder and more detached towards the world around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20678;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has failed me for the last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20678;A rational mind is all I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20678;Enough with the leeches!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20679;The guards drag me to the feet of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s bed. My liege coldly explains to me in a whisper that, while [From.GetSheHe] feels that the bloodlettings helped [From.GetHerHim] gain a new perspective on the nature of life, [From.GetSheHe] doubts that my intentions for starting the treatment were as pure as I claimed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20679;No, wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20690;Whatever [From.GetFirstName]'s plans were, [From.GetSheHe] will no longer be able to enact them. Yet, I have found that I do not wish to interrupt [From.GetHerHis] treatment. The clarity of mind and purity of intent given to me thanks to these bloodlettings have made me a much more effective [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20690;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20703;While [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s appetite is yet to return, the leeching seems to have stabilized [From.GetHerHis] condition. Some malicious courtiers have spread the rumor that the constant bloodletting is sucking away all humanity from my patient, but I doubt any of it is true.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20703;Superstitions, nothing more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20691;I look at the tumid leeches over my arm, feeling the bad blood being sucked out of me. My body may be weak, but I have never achieved such clarity of mind before. So many of the worries and attachments that bothered me in the past have now become inconsequential, and I am free to act however necessary to achieve my goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20691;No longer I am a slave to passion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20700;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is such a frail and gentle creature. Even the simplest actions are hard for her to perform. The more I see [From.GetHerHim], the more I am convinced that it is my duty as [From.GetHerHis] vassal to protect [From.GetHerHim] from harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20700;I must vow to protect [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20700;[From.GetSheHeCap] can handle [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20680;It has occurred to me since some time that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has started treating me with a peculiar care compared to my other vassals. Just today [From.GetSheHe] decided to openly state that [From.GetSheHe] feels duty-bound to protect me from any harm that may come to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20680;How convenient!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20680;I shouldn't take advantage of [From.GetHerHis] good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20681;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was touched by my concern, but [From.GetSheHe] decided to politely decline my offer of assistance, assuring me that [From.GetSheHe] is perfectly capable of handling [From.GetHerselfHimself] and that it would be immodest for me to be so close to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20681;I understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20682;My spouse [FromFrom.GetFirstName] spends too much time with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has developed an unhealthy relationship with that [From.GetManWoman], listening to [From.GetHerHis] every command.

EVTOPTAHFP20689;I should do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20692;It has just come to my attention that one of the bards under my patronage has just written a not too flattering song mocking [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s wide girth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP20692;I better remove the man from my employ.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20693;Tonight a new bard performed at [Root.Capital.GetName]. His songs were quite catchy, until I realized that in many of them the man was using clever metaphors to make fun of my weight, comparing me to a ravenous boar constantly eating roasted pigs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP20694;I was right not to worry. My bard played his piece and [From.GetTitledFirstName] laughed just as much as everybody else, although I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] understood the real meaning behind the bard's metaphors...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20694;The important thing is that nobody was hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20695;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the patron of the bard that entertained my court last night, took some time to apologize for the inappropriate nature of the songs this morning. [From.GetSheHeCap] was extremely relieved and happy when I told [From.GetHerHim] that I was well aware of the songs' meaning and that I enjoyed the performance regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20695;It is just a song, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20696;What I feared has happened: the bard's song greatly angered [From.GetTitledFirstName], to the point that my liege had the bard flogged and thrown out of court without much ceremony. Unfortunately, this morning I have heard news that the man has not even learned his lesson: he is going around the countryside, still performing his shameful pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20696;At least I am not his target...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20697;My equity was not appreciated, it seems. The bard was flogged and exiled from court, as he should have been, yet now he still persist in his irreverent behavior. I have heard news that he is wandering through the countryside, telling even more unflattering songs about me to everyone he meets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20697;I should have had him killed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20698;The unthinkable has happened: [From.GetTitledFirstName] was so furious of the bard's song that [From.GetSheHe] had the man roasted on the spot as punishment. I never imagined my liege could be such a cruel and ruthless [From.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20698;I best not get on [From.GetHerHis] bad side...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20699;As the smoking carcass of the bard is brought back to the main hall, nobody is laughing anymore. Perhaps now my subjects will understand the proper respect that is due to their [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

string_antagonized_desc_cynical;[From.GetTitledFirstName] barely conceals [From.GetHerHis] blasphemous lack of faith in [From.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Such a person should not be allowed to live in any proper society, [From.GetSheHe] should be shunned and condemned for [From.GetHerHis] heathen ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_antagonized_desc_deceitful;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s duplicitous nature may be a secret to [From.GetHerHis] friends and family, but it is quite clear to me. I should expose [From.GetHerHis] lack of honesty so that everyone knows to be wary of [From.GetHerHis] forked tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF22071;But of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22071_B;Spend the night with your new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22072;It seems my plan did not take into account [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s paranoid disposition. [From.GetSheHeCap] flatly refused my envoy's advances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22072;I will try something different next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22073;I cannot believe it! The man I slept with was a servant of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s! When I awoke after our night together he had disappeared, leaving only an ominous message telling me who his real master is. Even worse, I think sleeping with him made me terribly sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB22073;I cannot believe it! The woman I slept with was a servant of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s! When I awoke after our night together she had disappeared, leaving only an ominous message telling me who her real master is. Even worse, I think that sleeping with him made me terribly sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22073;That fiend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22074;The plan worked exactly as I hoped. My envoy easily seduced [From.GetTitledFirstName], infecting [From.GetHerHim] with a terrible disease. Perhaps now [From.GetFirstName] will understand the error of [From.GetHerHis] ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22074;Justice is served.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22076;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for being a slave to [From.GetHerHis] hunger. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] gluttony to my advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22076;I know exactly what to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22076_A;Prepare a poisoned feast for §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22076;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22077;I have just received the biggest boar I have ever seen from [From.GetTitledFirstName], who sent it to me as a sign of friendship. The beast looks marvelous, and I cannot wait to have it cooked for my next dinner. If only it weren't for the message coming with it mockingly implying I would eat it all by myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22077;If that's the case, I will eat none of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22077_A;Refuse §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22077;But I *will* eat it all myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22077_B;Eat §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! boar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22078;Perhaps I worded my message to [From.GetTitledFirstName] poorly. [From.GetSheHeCap] was angered by my gift for some reason and decided to refuse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22078;I will have to try something else...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22079;I probably shouldn't have eaten all the boar by myself. I am feeling horribly sick now, so much so that I can barely stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22079;This is all [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22080;Just as expected, [From.GetTitledFirstName] could not resist gorging upon my gift. According to the latest rumors, [From.GetSheHe] now lays in [From.GetHerHis] bed, stricken by a grievous sickness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22080;How predictable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22082;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] greed. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] love for money to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22082;A good old forgery will teach [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetHerHis] place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22082_A;Gift §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! a forged present, hoping [From.GetSheHe] will inadvertently embarrass [From.GetHerselfHimself] with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22082;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22083;I have just received a golden scepter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. According to the envoy who brought it to court, it is an old, priceless artifact which belonged to one of my ancestors and that [From.GetFirstName]'s scholars discovered recently at the borders of [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22083;This is too sacred a relic for me to flaunt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22083_A;Make sure that the artifact is kept safe and away from sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22083;What a marvelous addition to my crown jewels!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22084;It would appear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s humility has gotten in the way of my plan. Word has it that [From.GetFirstName] has locked the forged artifact I gifted [From.GetHerHim] away from sight, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is unworthy of carrying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22084;Curses. I will have to try something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22085;I am beset by shame. The supposedly priceless artifact sent by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is nothing but a piece of wood painted in gold. What is worse is that the forgery was revealed just as I was explaining the history of the scepter to a foreign dignitary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22085;My reputation is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22086;Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted my gift and could not resist flaunting it to [From.GetHerHis] friends and subjects. I have just received news that [From.GetSheHe] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] to shame in front of a foreign envoy a few days ago, when the forgery was revealed accidentally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22086;How amusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22088;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] slothful, apathetic attitude. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] distaste for all laborious tasks to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22088;Did [From.GetSheHe] surveyed [From.GetHerHis] borders recently?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22088_A;Send a falsified report on §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! demesne to force a new survey of [From.GetHerHis] borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22088;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22089;I have just received the most disturbing news. It has been brought to my attention that a recent survey of my lands has determined my demesne to be much smaller than I believed. All my Council members agree that I should verify the soundness of this report immediately if I do not wish to see the prestige of my realm be greatly diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22089;Who cares? It is just a piece of scroll.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22089_A;Ignore the survey.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22089;This is going to be so much work!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22089_B;Issue another survey of your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22090;It appears that [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not care enough about the legitimacy of [From.GetHerHis] borders in order to fall from my falsified report. [From.GetHerHisCap] inconstant nature must be the cause of this blunder.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22090;I will have to try something different.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22091;All of this work was for nothing! As it turns out, the survey report was a false document planted by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] to undermine my authority as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22091;I am so tired...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22092;Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] spent a lot of time and resources only to discover that the report I provided [From.GetHerHim] with was false.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22092;At least [From.GetSheHe] did something for a change...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22094;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] short temper. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] lack of patience to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22094;Is there not a parade in [From.GetHerHis] honor soon?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22094_A;Sabotage §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! parade to §YAntagonize§! [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22094;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22095;The musky odor of mud fills my lungs as I stare in disbelief at my soiled clothes. The two urchins run away laughing, while my parade suddenly halts in the middle of the streets and my servants start surrounding me, asking me if I am hurt and hastily starting to clean me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22095;It was but children...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22095_A;Forgive the slight against you and continue with your parade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22095;I will whip those dogs myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22095_B;Ride in pursuit of the two boys.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22096;My attempt to have [From.GetTitledFirstName] humiliate [From.GetHerselfHimself] did not succeed. According to reports, [From.GetSheHe] forgave the people I hired to disrupt [From.GetHerHis] parade without even trying to pursue them after their infraction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22096;[From.GetHerHis] kind nature is to blame...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22097;I immediately run after the two little criminals, but they have already disappeared. In my rage, I spend hours wandering around [Root.Capital.GetName] in my pitiful state, yelling for the two scoundrels to come out. When I finally return to my [Root.GetHouse], a letter from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] awaits me, implying the [FromFrom.GetTitle]'s involvement in the entire affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22097;Why is [FromFrom.GetSheHe] tormenting me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22098;Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] made a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself], running around [From.Capital.GetName] smeared in mud to try and apprehend the people I hired to harass [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22098;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22100;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] spiteful and opportunist nature. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] insatiable envy to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22100;A fake claim, maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22100_A;Provide a fake claim to one of §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! neighboring lands, hoping [From.GetSheHe] will humiliate [From.GetHerselfHimself] by trying to press it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22100;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22101;I have just received a wonderful gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetHerHisCap] Chancellor has recently discovered an old document legitimizing my claim on one of my neighbors' lands. [From.GetFirstName] has decided to offer it to me in a show of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22101;Thank you, but I do not need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22101_A;Refuse §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22101;Just what I need!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22102;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not interested in the false claim I provided [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] merely lacks the ambition to find my offer palatable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22102;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22103;Unbelievable! I was just about to press my new claim, when several clear inconsistencies were discovered in [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s document. The claim [From.GetSheHe] gave me is fabricated, and, more importantly, very poorly fabricated! Hardly anybody will consider it valid if I decide to press it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22103;This was all a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22104;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was just about to start a war over my false claim before [From.GetSheHe] finally realized how useless the document I provided [From.GetHerHim] with was. Now [From.GetSheHe] is boiling in [From.GetHerHis] own bile, all [From.GetHerHis] dreams of a quick conquest squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22104;Pathetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22106;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] pride. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] vain obsession with [From.GetHerselfHimself] to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22106;Call for the court painter!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22106_A;Have a very special painting of §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! delivered to [From.GetHerHim] as a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22106;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22107;An envoy from [From.Capital.GetName] has just delivered sumptuous portrait depicting me, as a gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The proportions and features are a bit off, but the quality of the piece is undeniable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22107;The portrait is nice, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22107_A;Accept §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! gift, but arrange for it to be placed somewhere remote where nobody will ever see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22107;It deserves to remain in plain sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tooltip_HF22107_B;Arrange for the portrait to be placed in the main hall of your [Root.GetHouse].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22108;Unfortunately, although [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted my gift, [From.GetHerHis] shy disposition prevented [From.GetHerHim] from putting the portrait on plain sight, where its true meaning would have been apparent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22108;I will have to try something different...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22109;I cannot believe the pettiness of some people. The painting [FromFrom.GetFirstName] gave me lasted only a few days before starting to melt, twisting my features in a grotesque mockery of reality and filling the main hall with a foul stench. What is worse, many dignitaries saw it before I was informed of the problem and hastily ordered the rotting artwork to be removed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22109;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22110;I have just received some hilarious news from [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s court. It appears the painting I gave [From.GetHerHim] has started to rot, both twisting the features of its subject into a ridiculous, grotesque mockery and filling [From.GetFirstName]'s palace with an unbearable stench.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22110;What an unexpected turn of events!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

REFORMATION_DESCRIPTION;We are presented with the unique opportunity to reshape our faith forever. We must be careful on the path we set out on, as once the new dogma of our religion has been established it will be impossible to change. Many learned priests and scholars have traveled to my court in order to discuss all sorts of theological matters in an attempt to codify a complete and solid reinterpretation of our old oral traditions. \nYet, being the one who made this reformation possible in the first place, it would only be fair if I gave my own opinion on the Nature, Doctrine, and Leadership of our new religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10104_C;Each blow of my weapon is becoming heavier, and I'm struggling to focus on my opponent, as the crowd cheers [other_combatant.GetHerHim] on. My vision is blurry when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] [other_combatant.GetKillingBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

String_push_my_weapon_into_their_chest;throw my [GetDuelWeapon], into [other_combatant.GetHerHis] stomach. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] falls, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] guts spilling out on the ground. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] does not rise again;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10107;I was holding my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] in front of me, locking eyes with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. The crowd began to whisper, as my opponent fidgeted awkwardly with [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face growing paler. I thought [other_combatant.GetSheHe] was about to faint, when the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] started running, away from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10107;Well, that was easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10108;Still shivering, I cannot explain what happened. When it all came down to it, my legs gave way and I simply... I fled the duel! I am such a coward..! Why did I ever agree to this in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10111_intrigue;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe], when something twisted passes over [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face.

The last thing I hear is the shocked gasp of the crowd, and a soft thud, which can only be my head hitting the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10111;Then there was nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10112_mock_duel;I know that there wasn't really anything at stake during the mock duel that took place between us, yet I find myself filling with rage whenever anyone mentions [other_combatant.GetTitledName], and it's making servants flinch. But does it matter? I am the [Root.GetTitle]! Am I not allowed to loathe that [other_combatant.GetManWoman]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10115_default;I have recently found myself talking with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] for hours, about [other_combatant.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak].

EVTDESC_HFP_10115_mock_duel;Since the duel, I have been practicing a bit with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] did best me, and I was quick to ask for any pointers. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] seemed surprised at first, but today I am proud to tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] that [other_combatant.GetSheHe]'s a good teacher. "And friend!" I add.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10116_default;I have recently found myself becoming friendly with [From.GetTitledFirstName].

EVTDESC_HFP_10116_mock_duel;After the duel, [From.GetTitledName] asked me for advice on fighting. A little taken aback, I happily offered to train with [From.GetHerHim], on occasion. Today, [From.GetSheHe] thanks me, for being a good teacher. "And friend," [From.GetSheHe] adds, dunking me on the back, before [From.GetSheHe] cocks [From.GetHerHis] head, in direction of the sparring grounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I keep seeing [other_combatant.GetHerHim] in my mind's eye, and my heart flutters. I can't tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] though... [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_new_crush_B;It's dark when I jolt awake, my heart pounding in my chest. Wiping the sweat from my brow, the memory of my dream lingers. I was dueling [other_combatant.GetFirstName] again, but instead of delivering the winning blow, this time, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] put [other_combatant.GetHerHis] arm around my waist, and pulled me in for a kiss. When will these dreams end?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_new_crush_C;I thought I saw [other_combatant.GetFirstName] today, in the fighting grounds. I was wrong, and the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] was startled to find [other_combatant.GetHerHis] liege putting a hand on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] shoulder. Embarrassed, I fled. Oh, why does my heart long for [other_combatant.GetFirstName]? [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_crushing_already;Ever since [other_combatant.GetFirstName] bested me in our duel, I yearn to be near [other_combatant.GetHerHim], even more than before. I'm filled with thoughts and visions of us together, yet I dare not approach [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_crush_past;I've had trouble sleeping, ever since the duel with [other_combatant.GetFirstName], and it's affecting my temper. When my councilors begged me to clarify my thoughts on a matter, I simply blurted out that "[other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry]";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10118;I have to express my feelings to [other_combatant.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_10118;[other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] must never know...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_finally_lovers;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], containing a rather solemn declaration of love. Upon reading it, my eyes start stinging, and I have to sit down. [From.GetHerHisCap] words are anxious, expectant. Does [From.GetSheHe] not know how I have harbored feelings for [From.GetHerHim] too?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_A;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], praising both my beauty and combat prowess. "Oh", I mumble. "A love letter?" The servant who handed it to me nods. "I... I guess that [From.GetRomanticObstacle], but...", I mumble. The [Root.GetBoyGirl] shifts uncomfortably, but I am re-reading the words, over and over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_B;"Dear [Root.GetFirstName]", the letter begins. As I keep reading, I feel my ears grow hot. A love letter? From [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I scratch my head. While I'm aware that [From.GetRomanticObstacle], I find my heart skipping a beat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_C;"I was told to give this to you in person", the servant says, handing me a letter, with the seal of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. "I think it's a love letter, [Root.GetMasterMistress]", the [Root.GetBoyGirl] continues. "From [From.GetFirstName]?" I ask incredulously, snatching the papers from [Root.GetHerHis] hands. After reading it, I am stuck re-reading it, over and over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10119;Servant! Fetch me a scribe! I have to respond to this love letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_10119;I would rather pretend I never received these news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10120_finally_lovers;As a servant [Root.GetBoyGirl] hands me a letter, I sigh. I've waited to hear from [From.GetFirstName] for what feels like ages, and every letter I receive in its stead feels like mockery. "What's this seal?" I mumble, suddenly curious. Soon, relief is washing over me. "[From.GetSheHeCap] wants to see me!" I laugh, and the servant smiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10120_A;While awaiting news from [From.GetFirstName], I have tried occupying myself... I briefly entertained the idea of courting a visiting diplomat, but I quickly realized it was only because [From.GetHerHis] hair was the exact same shade of color as that of [From.GetFirstName]'s... It seems silly now, reading the heartfelt words my [From.GetLordLady] has sent me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_1;"Oh, [Root.GetFirstName], I thought you'd never ask.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_honest;Telling the truth might be a winning strategy, after all...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_lustful;Oh, I look forward to my next dream about [From.GetHerHim]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_shy;The beautiful [From.GetManWoman] is encouraging me to stop hiding from my feelings...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_kind;I've never met someone as kind as [From.GetSheHe].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_envious;[From.GetSheHeCap] wonders how I could ever have been jealous, when [From.GetHerHis] heart is mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_cruel;[From.GetHerHisCap] words are inspiring! Oh, I will strive be more like [From.GetHerHim]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_2;So I was not being delusional...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10121;My [GetMyChancellorName] [advisor_target.GetFirstName] clasps [advisor_target.GetHerHis] hands in a gesture of sympathy. "No, my [Root.GetLordLady], we have not received any word from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Yes, I've made inquiries among the servants, and nobody has stolen any letters..." Avoiding [advisor_target.GetHerHis] gaze, I wave my hand dismissively. "I suppose that is a response in its own.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10121;I will not give up on our love...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_10121;It is useless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10005;[hero_character.GetTitledName] of [hero_character.Society.GetName] greets me with a brief nod. "Another recruit, huh? To join our ranks, you need to prove yourself, [Root.GetBoyGirl]", the [hero_character.GetManWoman] says gruffly, folding [hero_character.GetHerHis] arms across [hero_character.GetHerHis] chest. "You'd be fighting one of our own. Still interested, my [Root.GetLordLady]?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10005;I'll gladly fight to prove myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10005_TT;You agree to duel whoever it is that §Y[hero_character.Society.GetNameCap]§! has chosen for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10006_yes;[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] offered no protests when I explained our traditions, eyes all aglitter at the thought of an initiation duel. After some inquiry, [duel_target.GetTitledName] has kindly volunteered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_10006_TT_1;A sparring duel will take place between §Y[new_recruit.GetTitledName]§! and §Y[duel_target.GetTitledName]§!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10006_no;[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] listened while I explained our tradition of one-on-one duels, but then rolled [new_recruit.GetHerHis] eyes and walked off. "I would rather not get involved with barbarians.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10006_no;Why, that little-... The coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10095_mock_duel;My [hero_character.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.Society.GetName], [hero_character.GetTitledName], informs me that [combatant_1.GetBestName] needs someone to partake in a [combatant_1.GetDuelType], in an attempt for the eager recruit to prove [combatant_1.GetHerselfHimself] to us. The only respectable response would be to agree to help out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10096_mock_duel;[hero_character.GetBestName] and [From.Society.GetName] have chosen [From.GetTitledName] as my opponent. The [From.GetAgeAdjective] [From.GetManWoman] eyes me up and down when we are introduced. "Fresh meat, eh?" [From.GetSheHe] offers mockingly, before shoving an elbow into my side, making everyone laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10096;A [GetDuelType], huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10008_they_succeeded_greatly;Although I did not expect much, we were all stunned by the performance of [From.GetBestName] during [From.GetHerHis] initiation fight. It will be interesting to see what [From.GetSheHe] makes of [From.GetHerselfHimself], as a member of our ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10008_they_were_mildly_injured;In spite of some bruises and mild injury, I was not alone in being satisfied with the skill displayed by [From.GetBestName]. While I am intrigued, only time will tell whether joining our ranks is the right path for the [From.GetAgeAdjective] [From.GetManWoman], or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10008_they_were_seriously_injured;[From.GetBestName] was rather seriously injured by [From.GetHerHis] opponent, [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName].

[From.GetSheHeCap] is very attentive and I am sure [From.GetSheHe] will grow up to join me in the [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JD_30003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has reprimanded merchants in our region, citing misconduct in other realms. However, there are those arguing that the rights of merchants from [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] does not fall under the jurisdiction of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While it might anger the [From.GetTitle], I am considering a public show of resolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_30003;I'll make a public statement about [From.GetHerHis] blatant misuse of power!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10020_duelist;Having learned what I can about one-on-one combat, swinging my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] being as easy as breathing, I have decided that it is time I focused on other pursuits common among [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10020_strategist;Having studied many a tome on the topic, as well as the practical application of it, I am already well-versed in strategic warfare... Perhaps it is time I focused on something else?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10020_hunter;Having lost count of the [Root.GetRegionalBigAnimal] trophies which decorate the many walls of [Root.Capital.GetName], maybe I should spend some time on other pursuits befitting a member of [Root.Society.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10020;I should focus on personal combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10020;I want to delve deeper into strategic thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_10020;I shall spend more time outdoors, hunting!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HF_10020;On second thought, I like my current way of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10021;My fellow members of [Root.Society.GetName] have long been wondering when I will choose a focus for my fighting talents. There are those who live for the art of dueling, while others prefer the more theoretic side of combat... Yet hunting is also a worthwhile pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Perhaps it is time I admit that I could use some guidance, when it comes to my own dueling? If nothing else, I could join their training...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10022;I shall get [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] to teach me everything [mentor_target.GetSheHe] knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10022;I will discreetly hire someone to instruct me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_10022;I think I would rather go about this alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10023;My [From.GetRootRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has contacted me, asking for private lessons in the arts of one-on-one combat. "The [From.GetTitle] is likely to appreciate any guidance we offer, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the messenger says.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10023;I'll of course personally set up [From.GetHerHis] training regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10024_A;When we started practicing together, I had a hard time imagining displaying the kind of expert confidence that [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] exudes on the battlefield. However, bolstered by [mentor_target.GetHerHis] training, I think I have truly found my calling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10024_mentor_died;The last time we spoke, [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] had only praise to offer me. It's an odd feeling that [mentor_target.GetSheHe] is not here to see me now. Letting out a sigh, I clear my mind, focusing on the feeling of my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] in my hand. It's so natural to me now, as if part of my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10024_B;"Be careful where you point that thing!" a courtier cried out today, as I was sauntering back from yet another session at the training grounds, idly playing with the sword in my hand. The woman hurriedly corrected herself: "Of course, a master duelist such as yourself would know best, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10024_A;I'll always be grateful for your lessons, [mentor_target.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_10024_C;It took time, but I suppose all that hard work has paid off...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10025;The stack of books in front of me is intimidating. My scholars tell me these are classics, for anyone interested in an introduction to strategic warfare. But I am [Root.GetTitledFirstName]! Surely, I do not need the basics? Should I not be out on the field, surveying the troops, first-hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10025;There is value in the historical records.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10026;My commanders have come to request my advice on some exercises they are performing outside the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] walls. "We could really use that strategic mind of yours, [Root.GetMasterMistress]", they say. Startled, I realize that my studying has paid off, and my chest swells with pride. I then collect myself, nodding: "Of course, I'd be happy to help.";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10030;The experienced hunters I have spending time with seem quite pleased with my weapons skills, and are wondering what I would like to explore next. Poring over the maps of the area outside of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName], my advisors suggest I learn more about the theory behind the tracking of various prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10031;We have been tracking a wild [Root.GetRegionalBigAnimal] for hours, when a growl sounds in the bushes next to us. A thunk, followed by a soft groan, tells me that my arrow has found its target. Relaxing my posture, I realize that the hunt is over.

string_bon_training;nodding approvingly at my lightly packed horse. We are returning from an exercise in the mountains, and we are well ahead of schedule. "It is an honor training with you, [Root.GetFirstName]", the [fellow_member.GetManWoman] says, squeezing my shoulder briefly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

feudal_government_desc;Feudal government revolves around the oath between liege and vassal, and Feudal lords can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to rely on vassals - whose loyalty may vary... There are several Succession Laws to pick between - each with its own merits. The Centralization Law controls the maximum size of your Demesne and the number of direct vassals you can have. If you should convert to a religion in the [muslim.GetGroupName] group, your government form will change to Iqta.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
muslim_government_desc;The [arabic.GetGroupName] Iqta system is similar to the Feudal system - rulers must rely on land holding vassals of varying loyalty and ambition. The maximum number of vassals and the number of Holdings you can directly own are controlled by the Centralization Law. However, there is only one form of Succession available - the chaotic 'Open' type, where the son with most land inherits. If you should convert to a non-[muslim.GetGroupName] religion, your government form will change to Feudal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The amount of Decadence these men incur on their dynasty depends on their own social status as well as the total amount of Holdings controlled by the Dynasty.

Granting landed titles to dynasty members\n§G*§! Successfully convincing decadent Dynasty members to abandon their sinful ways\n§G*§! Imprisoning, banishing or killing decadent Dynasty members\n§G(The Religion View contains a list of decadent dynasty members.)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Monastic Feudal government is unique to [tibetan_group.GetGroupName] of either the [buddhist.GetName] or [bon.GetName] faiths, and allows holding Temples in addition to Castles.

Your faithful vassals stand beside you, while the rest of your subjects wait their turn behind them, looking still visibly confused. The Bishop recites a few verses from [catholic.GetScriptureName] before you lead your vassals into the river. As you pass the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests they baptize you, one after the other, in the cold water. It takes some prodding from the guards to convince the peasants to follow you into the water, but, after a while, the entire crowd stands soaked and shaking by the riverside, just in time to watch the priests and their helpers drop your old idols into the waves.\n"As the false visages are swallowed by the tides" the Bishop proclaims, "may their memory forever be banished from your soul.";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10014_A;My [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] has joined me for dinner tonight, but not said a single word for what feels like an eternity. When I try to coax some conversation out of the [new_recruit.GetBoyGirl], [new_recruit.GetSheHe] mumbles: "I am not like you, [Root.GetFatherMother]", face red with shame. "I failed my initiation rite.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10014_B;My [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] has joined me for dinner tonight, but not said a single word for what feels like an eternity. When I try to coax some conversation out of the [new_recruit.GetBoyGirl], [new_recruit.GetSheHe] mumbles: "Don't be mad. I changed my mind about joining [Root.Society.GetName].";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10017_A;My [From.GetFatherMother] tells me that it does not matter which path I walk. "Whether you choose the way of the sword, or the way of the quill, you are my [Root.GetSonDaughter]." We spent the rest of the evening talking about other hopes and dreams of mine, and I can only smile fondly when I think of [From.GetHerHis] support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10017_1;Family is what is most important, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10017_2;I am lucky to have [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10017_B;My [From.GetFatherMother] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] expected more from my duel, before eating the remainder of [From.GetHerHis] dinner in silence.\nI feel awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_10017_TT;You'll show [From.GetHerHim]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11001_A;A bird cries out and I wake up. I hear men roaring in the distance. Why am I on the ground, staring at the sky? I... I cannot move.\nIs this how [Root.GetBestName] leaves this world?\n"Go with [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]", comes the ragged voice of a wounded soldier next to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11001_B;I cannot stop coughing. Something is filling my lungs. An enemy soldier is shouting orders, but I am having a hard time focusing on the words. My knees give way, and I am on the ground, dropping my [GetDuelWeapon].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11001_C;I am surrounded. Blood is streaking down my face and my [GetDuelWeapon] has begun to feel heavy. A huge [GetRegionalFerociousAnimal] of a [enemy_commander.GetManWoman] is looming towards me, but seems to decide that I am not worth the trouble. I have just enough time to wonder why before someone runs a sword through my chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11003;During the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName] I manage to corner and cut down [home_commander.GetTitledName], hopefully teaching [home_commander.GetHerHis] troops a valuable lesson.\nIn the aftermath, my scouts find a weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10003;[home_commander.GetHerHisCap] [home_commander.GetDuelWeapon]? I'll take that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_10003;Let [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName] decide what to do with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_10003;I could never steal from the dead! This belongs to [home_commander.GetHerHis] family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11004_A;A weapon has been found by my soldiers. "It was dropped by [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName], my [Root.GetLordLady], at the recent battle of [battlefield_location.GetName]" my commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] says, presenting the item.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11005_B;In the battle chaos of [battlefield_location.GetName] my men cornered [home_commander.GetTitledName], [home_commander.GetOnCombatDeathDesc].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11010_A;The [battlefield_location.GetLocalWeatherAdjective] weather is getting to me. Turning to the sky, I take a deep breath. The [enemy_liege.GetEnemySoldierDesc] soldiers of [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been sending their best at me and my limbs are becoming heavier with each step I take.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11010_B;While my soldiers are fighting valiantly alongside me, one [enemy_liege.GetEnemySoldierDesc] buffoon wearing the colors of [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have figured out that I am the one holding the troops together. Through the haze of my tired mind, I sense [Root.GetHerHis] lumbering advance, and [Root.GetHerHis] intent to do something about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11010_C;My troops are performing with excellence, and my chest is swelling with pride as we keep pressing forward. I turn back to answer the call of a soldier near by, when suddenly there is a sharp pain in my [Root.GetBodyPartInjured]. Gritting my teeth, I hear an enemy shouting: "Stay down, you [GetRootFromInsult]!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_A;I accept any injury, if it protects [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_B_1;I think I will rest behind this [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence] for a moment...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_B_2;They will have to catch me first!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_B_3;You don't have to ask me twice! I will stay down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_C;Heeey, leave my [Root.GetBodyPartInjured] alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11011_A;The landscape surrounding [battlefield_location.GetName] is a sight to behold. I wish I was not here for a battle. Once all of this is over, maybe I will come out here with [my_beloved.GetFirstName]..?\nMy [GetDuelWeapon] is suddenly kicked out of my hand, and a scruffy-looking soldier shouts, voice like a demon: "I'll get your [GetBodyPartInjured]!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11011_B;"You [GetRootFromInsult]!" the [enemy_liege.Culture.GetName] soldier yells as he charges at me, his expression more that of a wild animal than man. For a moment time stands still, as I am watching the movement of a shiny sword coming straight for my [GetBodyPartInjured].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11011_C; I try to breathe deeply, but catching my breath in the [battlefield_location.GetLocalTemperature] weather is difficult. "Look, it's the [Root.GetTitle] [Root.GetHerselfHimself]!" someone shouts. I turn, only to find myself overrun by a dozen of [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s [enemy_liege.GetEnemySoldierDesc] soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_A;You won't get the best of me – I need that [Root.GetBodyPartInjured]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_B;Wait! How about you just take this [equipped_artifact.GetName] and let me live?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_B_TT_weapon;You throw your weapon to the ground. Then you run.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11012_A;One moment I am shouting orders, surrounded by the clanging of swords and fighting around me. The next, everything goes dark, as the world slips away from me. Are those... people, concerned faces? Everything hurts. I just want to... rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11012_B;One moment I am shouting orders, surrounded by the clanging of swords and fighting around me. Then my memory fades, and I find myself on the ground, lying in a mixture of blood and [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc], my ears ringing with pain. A soldier runs past me, but he seems to assume I am dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11012;The fight will have to go on... without me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11012_tt;§Y[Root.GetBestName]§! receives a crushing blow to the head and shows no sign of waking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_11012_tt;You gingerly pull the spear from your cheek. It is more than a grazing wound...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11013_A;It has been ages since I felt so invigorated by a battle. "Every day, our unit is moving as if connected by some unspoken bond", I exclaim eagerly one night. "Or a higher power of some kind!"\n"Uhm, this is all you, my [Root.GetLordLady]", one of my soldier says, a look of genuine surprise on his face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11013;This is a team effort, soldier.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11013;You're right! Modesty will get me nowhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11014_A;As I describe the plan for our movement across the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], my officers listen intently before running back to their units to pass on the instructions. Morale has been good lately. Conflicts are non-existent within our regiment, and we are becoming famous for our [Root.GetMilitarySquadPride].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11014;Good leadership requires trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11014;They are simply becoming more confident in themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11014;Strategy is truly an art form in itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11015;Rumors are trickling in from the troops present at the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName]. My commander [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName] has been making a great impression on [home_commander.GetHerHis] soldiers, and [home_commander.GetHerHis] regiment is famous for their [home_commander.GetMilitarySquadPride]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11015;Let [home_commander.GetHerHim] be a shining example for our recruits!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11016;Our ongoing struggle outside of [battlefield_location.Capital.GetName] has brought out the best of our military strategists. One of them is a [invited_character.Culture.GetName] veteran with a penchant for innovation. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] is suggesting that [invited_character.GetSheHe] retire from the battlefront, and return to [home_capital_province.GetName] to continue [invited_character.GetHerHis] work, safe from flying arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11016;This sounds like a solid investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11016;Nonsense. We need any resource available to us, here at the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
war_knowledge_desc;This community is working hard on military technological innovation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11017;"One day, you'll have to specialize". I hear the voice of my old quartermaster in my head. As I look out over the battlefield and the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName], the sight fills me with resolve. I need to find a focus for future battles, but what will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11020;We are marching [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], when one of my officers mutters: "Once I'm back in [home_capital_province.GetName], I'm giving up this soldiering life and... Maybe I will be a baker!" I chuckle, considering my own more strategic aspirations. "What about you, my [Root.GetLordLady]? What will you focus on in the future?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11020;Logistics and organization, my good [Root.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11020;I want to be more direct, I think. Yes, definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11020;I want to carry out the will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_11020;I will never surrender a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11021;"[Root.GetFirstName]! You [Root.GetEnemySoldierDesc] brute!" a shout carries [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], where I am fighting a close battle alongside my personal guards. In the distance, I see enemy reinforcements coming our way. "Listen-", I begin to my soldiers...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11021;We are going to DESTROY them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11022;I am [GetRidingMarching] [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName] when I realize how this experience has simply become matter of course. I rarely even think when I charge into battle – it just happens! I could surely make use of this insight, but how?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11022;I will master the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11022;I will focus on flanking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HFP_11022;Siege tactics! Why have I not thought of this before?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11023;There are people who would say that my interrogation techniques are appalling, but I would remind them that this is war. There is no such thing as 'unnecessary violence'. Turning back to my prisoner, I continue out loud: "Where are the rest of your troops hiding? Hmm?! I'll search the whole [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]!". I am met with sobs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11023_A;I...The look on your face. You're just a boy...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11023_B;Crying will get you nowhere. You are but a tool of my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11024;I interrupted Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] while [From.GetSheHe] was interrogating an prisoner to find out where our enemy would attack next. The guard who brought me to [From.GetFirstName] accused [From.GetHerHim] of using unnecessary violence and looked at me for support. "My [Root.GetLordLady]?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11024;Aah, yes, the cruelty of war. Carry on, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11024;What is the meaning of this? I do not approve of this conduct!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11024;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s right, we should terrorize our enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_A_weapon;Just as I am about to cut the enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName] throws [home_commander.GetHerHis] weapon to the ground, scrambles to [home_commander.GetHerHis] feet and starts running. My soldiers trip over each other in their sudden attempt to catch up with [home_commander.GetHerHim], but to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_A_armor;Just as I am about to cut [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName] in two, the enemy commander wriggles out of [home_commander.GetHerHis] armor, picks [home_commander.GetHerselfHimself] up, and runs the other way. Dumbfounded, my soldiers and I are left lowering our weapons, staring as the half-naked runner disappears from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_A_other;"Any last words?!" I shout, as I am about to cut down [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName], the enemy commander. The [home_commander.GetManWoman] groans and tosses something into the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc] between us. I hesitate for a second, and my enemy uses the opportunity to start running away, leaving me staring at the item on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_B_weapon;I am told that just as my soldiers were about to cut an enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetManWoman] threw [home_commander.GetHerHis] weapon to the ground, scrambled to [home_commander.GetHerHis] feet and left [home_commander.GetHerHis] enemies staring in confusion. "[home_commander.GetSheHeCap] dropped this, my [Root.GetLordLady]" the courier says, handing me the bounty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_B_armor;I am told that just as my soldiers were about to cut an enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetManWoman] wriggled out of [home_commander.GetHerHis] armor and ran the other way, causing such a distraction that "[home_commander.GetSheHe] probably got away uninjured", the courier says, handing me the bounty. "Unless [home_commander.GetSheHe] ran into a tree, my [Root.GetLordLady]".;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_B_other;I am told that just as my soldiers were about to cut an enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetManWoman] tossed something in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc], distracting my soldiers and making a hasty escape.

EVTOPTA_HFP_11019_2;I do NOT have nightmares, servant! How dare you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11019_B;Having returned from the battlefield, I still don't feel at home. My body is here, but my mind is still in [battlefield_location.GetName]. Sometimes I wonder if I died there and this is all a nightmare. Sometimes I cannot breathe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_11019_2;Some solitude, that's all I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11019_C;After the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName], it has been my duty to inform the families of fallen soldiers of their fate. At night, I still see the hatred burning in the eyes of a teenage daughter. I know it is not my fault, but I have destroyed their lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11019_1;It should have been me, not their brave [Root.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11025_dog;Swinging my blade [Root.GetClumsilyElegantly] in front of me, while my trusted dog gnaws at the legs of my enemies, the battle rages on [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]. Then there is a cry from a soldier nearby. "Incoming arrows! My [Root.GetLordLady], watch out! Wait, what is that dog-" *thwack*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_cat;My cat has become a true treasure here [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], acting as an anchoring kindness to any injured soldier. Of course, I was annoyed when I first found that it had gone to sleep in one of my saddle bags and followed me into battle, but now I am really coming around to- *thwack*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_horse;My horse and I are of one mind and body. Having trained together for long, the enemy has begun fearing us both. "Watch out, it's [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetWarhorseName]!" they tell each other. When I sleep, [Root.GetWarhorseName] sleeps. So when a blade cuts into [Root.GetHerHim], I feel like I bleed too...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_owl;Some argued when my owl came with us on this campaign, but between the comforting presence it brings our strategic meetings and the distracting screeching it offers our enemies, protests have ceased. "Attack!" I yell [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], and my owl swooshes above my head. Then I see the arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_eagle;Not everybody has a personal bodyguard in the shape of a majestic eagle at their side. More than once [Root.GetSheHe] has aided my attacks here [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] and charging at my enemies, knocking them off their horses, into the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc].

EVTDESC_HFP_11025_falcons;Riding [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] I am finding my strength draining from me.

EVTDESC_HF_41316;The journey to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] has been planned for a while. I have spent a lot of time preparing for whatever risks I might meet on my way to [pilgrimage_destination.Realm.GetName].

EVTOPTA_HF_41316;An exciting journey begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41320;I come across another group of pilgrims, also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_saint.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_41320_ALT_3;I come across another group of pilgrims, also traveling to Antioch, to ask for the blessing of Saint Christopher. Traveling together could be beneficial, and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41320;Friendly company? That sounds like a nice change of pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41320;A proper pilgrim travels alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41340;I am suddenly met by a couple of rough looking fellows, as I proceed through the woods. The leader gives me a toothy grin and asks for protection money, for the service he and his men are doing in the woods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41340;It is probably easier to just pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41340;I will show them who needs protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41350;It is getting progressively colder, as I am getting closer to my destination. By my own estimates, I should be halfway to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] by now. I am not used to long hikes like these, but it has been a nice change of pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_41360;I come across a group of caravans, filled with the laughter and joy of a group of traveling entertainers. As day turns to night, I enjoy the company of the group. A particularly beautiful [Root.GetManWomanOpp] is teasing me, and invites me to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_41360;That sounds like a nice suggestion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41360;What kind of [Root.GetManWoman] do you think I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41365;It has been a long day of traveling, when I come across a burning inn. I had hoped to find a place to stay the night, but these people are clearly in dire need of help just stopping the flames from engulfing the entire place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41365;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to help out these poor people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41365;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to continue my pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_41370;A loud roar, and suddenly there is a huge furry creature just down the road. A bear? Now? Here? This must be a creature sent by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] to test me and my faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41370;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is testing my strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HF_41370;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is testing my intelligence!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41375;I feel like I have been walking in circles for the last hours, and I am sure I have seen these trees before. If I continue walking in circles, I will never get out of here. A plan would be nice, but what kind of options do I have?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41375;I will cut my path out of here, one tree at a time if I have to!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41375;I just need to be patient, and slowly find my way out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_41375_TT2;finding something else...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_41375;Oh, it is that way, clearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41390;The rain is pouring down and I am desperately looking for a shelter, when I come across an old church. A priest welcomes me inside, gives me some warm clothes and a hot meal. When he mentions that it probably will not stop raining for a couple of days, I wonder if I have time to wait for that long.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41390;It is better to rest a couple of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41390;A real pilgrim would not let weather stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_HF_41390_TT;Not necessarily good for my health..;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41400;I wake up with a sudden, to the hissing of a snake right next to me. This creature of the [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] must have been sent to test my faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41400;I will vanquish this evil foe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41400;I will just get away from this cursed place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_41400;Maybe I should hold onto this little one, just in case?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41410;According to all maps I have seen, there should just be wilderness here. And yet here I am standing in the middle of an empty town square. I occasionally see people through the windows, looking skeptically at me. I walk down to the town chapel, hoping to find a sensible soul there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41410;What is this place?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41411;I open the door, and there is a huge bloody altar and dark clad people filling the room. They all turn towards me, pulling out their daggers and knives as the high priest suddenly starts talking. He bids me welcome, as I am the one who apparently will bring forth an old one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41411;What is this talk of old ones?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41411;Blasphemers, I will cut you down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41412;The dark priest explains the ritual, which includes all of us being burnt down with the unholy church. After the church has burnt down, we will all be reborn with the old one and destroy the world as it exists right now, and reshape it in our image.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41412;I will go along with the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_41412;This is crazy! I would rather fight my way out of here than go along with this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41413;I wake up, all alone in the middle of a field. I do not know what have happened with the villagers and the cultists, nor where they have gone. The last thing I remember, was the church burning down with us inside it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_41413;I.. guess I will continue my pilgrimage?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41419;All of a sudden, I find myself in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] before I know it. It has been a long journey through the wilds, to once more see people is a nice change. As I walk through the city streets, I compare it to my homeland, and how the people have dealt with the cold and ice in these lands.

EVTDESC_HF_41420_A;The whole area is filled with people, looking like they come from all the different corners of the world. I see another [Root.Culture.GetName] looking at me, and giving me a small nod before [Root.GetSheHeOpp] disappears in the crowd. I never knew  [pilgrimage_destination.province_saint.GetFirstNameWithNick] was this popular or well known.

EVTDESC_HF_41420_B;There is a couple of other pilgrims around, but they all look relatively local to the area. I walk over to the grave, and look down at the small statue of the saint as well as the stone commemorating the life of the saint.

EVTDESC_HF_41420_C;The burial site is completely void of people, not a single soul to be seen. I look around for it, almost sure I am at the wrong place for a moment, and then I see the small grave. It looks overgrown and deserted, and I take some time to tidy the place up before I finally sit down in prayer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. It is almost like  [pilgrimage_destination.province_saint.GetFirstNameWithNick] is here and prays with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_41420_ALT;The whole area is empty besides a nun cleaning a corner of the small chapel. She approaches me, and asks if I am here to see the grave of Saint Patrick. I give here a small nod, before she brings me to the large rock where he presumably lie. She kneels down next to me, and we take a moment to pray to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] together.

EVTDESC_HF_42021_HUNT;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to join [From.GetHerHim] on a hunt. This could be an opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_DUEL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to join [From.GetHerHim] in a dueling tournament, where [From.GetSheHe] need a partner. This could be an opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_GAME;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to join [From.GetHerHim] for a board game evening. This could be a good opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_SOCIAL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation for an upcoming banquet. This is probably a good opportunity to get to know each other better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_SCHOLAR;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to an upcoming discussion. I might learn something about both the discussed subject and get to know [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_STEWARD;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to a local festival at [From.Capital.GetName]. It would be a good opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_TORTURE;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to what I assume is torture of [From.GetHerHis] prisoners. This could be a chance to get to know each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42021;Sounds like it could be fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42021;I have more important business to take care of.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_HUNT;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to join a hunt, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to join at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_DUEL;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to join the tournament, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to spare at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_GAME;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the board game evening, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to spare at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_SOCIAL;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the banquet, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time for something frivolous like that at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_SCHOLAR;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the discussion, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_STEWARD;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the local festival, but sadly [sway_target.GetSheHe] cannot find them to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_TORTURE;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation, but was not interested in joining right now. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42022;Maybe next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_HUNT;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gives me a smile, as we start walking into the local forests around [Root.Capital.GetName]. I have been waiting for this for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_DUEL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] looks excited as the first rounds of the tournament starts. I brandish my blade, and am ready as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_GAME;[From.GetTitledFirstName] inquires about the nature of the game we will play, as the other attendees readies the board. A game about warfare is fitting for rulers like us, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_SOCIAL;I receive [From.GetTitledFirstName] at the door, and help [From.GetHerHim] inside. [From.GetSheHeCap] look around the large room, and give me an approving nod of the size of the banquet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_SCHOLAR;[From.GetFirstName] is the last one to arrive to the discussion. The conversation flows freely between everyone, jumping from topic to topic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_STEWARD;All kinds of sights can be seen as we walk through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Masked jugglers and people having fun all around us. I decide to show [From.GetHerHim] the local hedge-maze, to top it off. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_TORTURE;I happily guide [From.GetFirstName] down the stairs to the dungeon, as soon as [From.GetSheHe] gets to [Root.Capital.GetName]. We have a lot of fine specimen here in [Root.Capital.GetName], and this is a prime opportunity to test them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42023_HUNT;Let the hunt begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42023_DUEL;We will take the win, for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42023_GAME;Hopefully [sway_target.GetSheHe] will have fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42023_SOCIAL;Time to enjoy ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42023_SCHOLAR;Let us try and learn as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42023_STEWARD;I hope [From.GetSheHe] will have fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42023_TORTURE;Let us have some fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_HUNT;[From.GetTitledFirstName] expertly guides us through the forests. It is clear [From.GetSheHe] knows this area well. [From.GetFirstName] tells me we are looking for a wild boar that has been sighted in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_DUEL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] expertly fences us through the first rounds of the tournament, it is clear [From.GetSheHe] has a lot of prior experience with fencing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_GAME;[From.GetTitledFirstName] helps me ready for the event, and explains the game to me. Though there is some details still unclear to me, [From.GetFirstName] promises to help me out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_SOCIAL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] receives me at the door, and invites me inside. The banquet is larger than I originally expected, with nice looking lords and ladies all across the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_SCHOLAR;[From.GetTitledFirstName] receives me at the door, and helps me get seated in the tiny room. The discussion quickly switches between different and difficult topics, and I am just trying to keep up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_STEWARD;All kinds of sites can be seen at [From.Capital.GetName]. [From.GetFirstName] shows me around the city happily, and we have a lot of fun as we come across all kinds of entertainers and events. In the end [From.GetSheHe] brings me to a local hedge-maze. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_TORTURE;As soon as I get to [Root.Capital.GetName], [From.GetFirstName] receives me at the door, and brings me down to the dungeon. We walk past all kinds of people, looking downtrodden and like they have been through [From.GetHerHis] torture before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42024_HUNT;I wonder if we will find it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42024_DUEL;I am impressed by [From.GetHerHis] swordsmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42024_GAME;I will try my best to win this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42024_SOCIAL;Better than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42024_SCHOLAR;This will be interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42024_STEWARD;I have to say I am impressed by [From.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42024_TORTURE;This will be.. Interesting?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_HUNT;Hours pass with little to no excitement, when suddenly we come across the boar we were looking for. My soldiers look at me, waiting for my orders to wait it out or to hunt it down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_DUEL;We pass through all the preliminary rounds with little to no issue. In the last round we are facing two large ogre looking men, the swords tiny in their hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_GAME;As the game develops, [From.GetFirstName] and I end up partnering up. I can already see that one of us will have to sacrifice all of their units, to be able to get a win. [From.GetFirstName] does not seem to have noticed this yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_SOCIAL;Several hours passes, and [From.GetFirstName] seem to enjoy [From.GetHerselfHimself]. Maybe [From.GetSheHe] would enjoy [From.GetHerselfHimself] even more if we managed to find [From.GetHerHim] some company for the night?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_SCHOLAR;Some hours pass as the discussions continue. We come to an impasse about the nature of the universe, with [From.GetFirstName] and I together at one side of the discussion. [From.GetSheHeCap] looks at me, clearly waiting for me to make the first line of reasoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_STEWARD;At the start we are having fun as we walk through the hedge-maze, but at some point I start losing track of where we are. I get to a cross-road, and I am not sure which path I have to take to get us out. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_TORTURE;We start testing out the different tools we have at hand, and quickly work our way through a couple of the prisoners. They almost look spiffy after we are done with them, and I have to say, we are being quite generous as we leave them mostly intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42025_HUNT;We attack it right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42025_DUEL;The larger they are, the harder they fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42025_GAME;I will position myself to take the brunt of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42025_SOCIAL;I will help [From.GetHerHim] find someone. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42025_SCHOLAR;I will be assertive, and explain them why they are wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42025_STEWARD;Confidently take a path and hope for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42025_TORTURE;Let us see how far we can push one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_HF_42025_HUNT;I rush in and attack the beast. A higher chance of getting wounded, but also a higher chance of success if §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! decides to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_HF_42025_DUEL;I decide to go on the offense. A higher chance of getting wounded, but also a higher chance of success if §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! goes on the offense as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_HF_42025_GAME;You decide to set yourself in a precarious situation. A higher chance of success, if §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! sees what you are doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_HF_42025_SOCIAL;I decide to try and help §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! find someone to spend the night with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_HF_42025_SCHOLAR;I decide to be assertive in my reasoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_HF_42025_STEWARD;I decide to try your luck. This has a lower chance of success, but §Y[From.GetFirstName]§! will not know that I have no idea where we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_HF_42025_TORTURE;I decide to see how far I can push a specimen and still keep it alive. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42025_HUNT;Let us wait it out, and trap it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42025_DUEL;I will tire them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42025_GAME;I will manipulate [From.GetTitledFirstName] into taking most of the losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42025_SOCIAL;Let us just enjoy the evening for what it is worth, no need to stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42025_SCHOLAR;Let us hold back, and disprove their arguments instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42025_STEWARD;Be honest and try to reason our way out together.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42025_TORTURE;Let us take it slow, and see how long they can withstand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_HF_42025_HUNT;I wait it out. A lower chance of getting wounded, but also a lower chance of success overall, unless §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! decides to attack it on his own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_HF_42025_DUEL;I wait for them to tire out. A lower chance of getting wounded, but also a lower chance of success overall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_HF_42025_GAME;I decide to set §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! in a precarious situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_HF_42025_SOCIAL;I decide to just enjoy the evening. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_HF_42025_SCHOLAR;I decide to let the other side have the first word.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_HF_42025_STEWARD;I decide to be honest about being lost, and try to reason our way out together.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_HF_42025_TORTURE;I decide to take it slow, and see how long a specimen can stay sane.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_HUNT;We come across the boar we have been looking for, and [From.GetFirstName] rush in and attack the wild animal without a word. The wild animal turn around, and charge at [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_DUEL;We finally reach the finale of the tournament, and our last opponents are two large men. [From.GetFirstName] rush in from the start, and stay on the offensive against both of the two men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_GAME;The game is starting to develop into a bloodbath, as the armies are clashing together. [From.GetFirstName] seem to set [From.GetHerselfHimself] in a horrible position, though it leaves an opening for me to take out a lot of our opponents' units.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_SOCIAL;I am having fun as the evening turns to night. [From.GetFirstName] aggressively pairs me up with one guest after another, it is almost like [From.GetSheHe] is trying to get me some company for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_SCHOLAR;Several hours has passed, and the discussion has reached an impasse when it comes to the nature of the universe. [From.GetFirstName] and I agree, but now we need to find out how to convince everyone else. [From.GetFirstName] starts aggressively making [From.GetHerHis] arguments. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_STEWARD; I start wondering if we have gotten lost as we walk through the hedge-maze, but [From.GetFirstName] confidently keeps up the pace. Is the hedge-maze really that big, or is [From.GetFirstName] terrified of telling me [From.GetSheHe] does not know the way out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_TORTURE;[From.GetFirstName] picks out one of the prisoners, and starts mercilessly torture the individual, pulling it through the rack. If this keeps up for much longer, I am sure the individual will break in no time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42026_HUNT;I will aid [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42026_DUEL;We will fight together!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42026_GAME;No, I will aid [From.GetFirstName] so [From.GetSheHe] can save most of [From.GetHerHis] units.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42026_SOCIAL;Let us find me someone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42026_SCHOLAR;We need to be on the offensive, I will back [From.GetHerHim] up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42026_STEWARD;I will try to reason with [From.GetHerHim], which way will lead us out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42026_TORTURE;Let me in on the fun as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42026_HUNT;[From.GetSheHeCap] should have been more careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42026_DUEL;I will hold back, and let the others tire themselves out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42026_GAME;I will take advantage of this opportunity, so we can win the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42026_SOCIAL;It is all right, I am already having fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42026_SCHOLAR;[From.GetFirstName] got this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42026_STEWARD;[From.GetSheHeCap] probably knows the way out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42026_TORTURE;We should take it slow instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_HUNT;We come across the boar we have been looking for, but [From.GetFirstName] does not give the order to engage. I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] is waiting it out, unsure what to do or is just being a coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_DUEL;We finally reach the finale of the tournament, and our last opponents are two large men. [From.GetFirstName] wait them out, and dodge back and forth, apparently trying to tire them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_GAME;The game is starting to develop into a bloodbath, as the armies are clashing together. There seems to have been some sort of miscommunication between [From.GetFirstName] and myself, as I have been put in a terrible position where most of my units are getting slaughtered, whereas [From.GetSheHe] is holding [From.GetHerHis] units back. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_SOCIAL;I am having fun as the evening turns to night. [From.GetFirstName] seem to be a pretty content host, occasionally bringing people over to talk to me. Should a host not be a bit more assertive?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_SCHOLAR;Several hours has passed, and the discussion has reached an impasse when it comes to the nature of the universe. [From.GetFirstName] and I agree, but now we need to find out how to convince everyone else. [From.GetFirstName] let the other side speak their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_STEWARD;Some minutes pass, and [From.GetFirstName] admits we seem to have gotten lost in the large hedge-maze. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks me for my thoughts, on how we should try to get out of here. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_TORTURE;[From.GetFirstName] picks out one of the prisoners, and puts the individual at a Judas cradle. Every five minutes [From.GetFirstName] lowers the individual a bit further down on the device, making small talk as [From.GetSheHe] proceeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42027_HUNT;I will rush in and take care of it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42027_DUEL;The offense is the only way to take people like that out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42027_GAME;Fine, I will win this on my own then!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42027_SOCIAL;I should try and find some company for the night. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42027_SCHOLAR;We need to be assertive, and I will speak my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42027_STEWARD;We should just keep walking, and we will find our way in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42027_TORTURE;Let us just get this over with already, no need to drag it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42027_HUNT;Let us wait it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42027_DUEL;Yes, let us tire them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42027_GAME;I believe [From.GetSheHe] has a plan, and will hold my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42027_SOCIAL;I will just try and enjoy the rest of the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42027_SCHOLAR;Let them show their own incompetence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42027_STEWARD;Let us try and remember where we came from in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_42027_TORTURE;This is delicate work, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_HUNT_SUCCESS;Though the boar fought valiantly, we finally bring the beast down, to loud cheers from all our retainers. It has been a good hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_HUNT_FAILURE;Though we fight valiantly and the beast look weakened, it flees as I am about to land the final strike. Our retainers look for it, but it cannot be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_DUEL_SUCCESS;Though the two lumbering men fought for their lives, they finally give up and fall to the ground exhausted. I look over at [From.GetFirstName] and cheer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_DUEL_FAILURE;After a long dance of steel back and forth, I finally have to admit defeat to our two opponents, and so do [From.GetFirstName]. Both teams fought well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_GAME_SUCCESS;Though it was a long match with casualties on both sides, [From.GetFirstName] and I finally crush our remaining opponents between our two armies. Thankfully, [From.GetFirstName] understood what I wanted us to do. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_GAME_FAILURE;Though it was a long match with casualties on both sides, the last of [From.GetFirstName] and my units finally fall to our opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SOCIAL_SUCCESS;I wake up half-dressed, clothes strewn everywhere with a [Root.GetManWomanPreference] sleeping besides me. I can see [From.GetFirstName] with a grin on [From.GetHerHis] face, lying on the floor with a [From.GetManWomanPreference] on top of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SOCIAL_FAILURE;I wake up with a massive headache, and [From.GetFirstName] had apparently already left the premises.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SCHOLAR_SUCCESS;The discussion continues on into the night, but the other side yield their points one by one. In the end, there is no doubt that [From.GetFirstName] and I are the undisputed winners of the discussion. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SCHOLAR_FAILURE;The discussion continues on into the night, but we slowly lose point by point. In the end, there is no doubt that we have lost the discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_STEWARD_SUCCESS;We turn a corner, and finally find the exit. I let out a small chuckle, as I confidently shows [From.GetFirstName] that we have indeed gotten out of here. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_STEWARD_FAILURE;Several hours pass as we keep walking around the hedge-maze, and [From.GetFirstName] is getting increasingly annoyed at the prospect at spending the night here. Finally my retainers decide to come look for us, and help us find the way out again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_TORTURE_SUCCESS;I am certain this was a massive success, as most of our specimen stayed intact throughout the tests we did. Not to mention all the fun we had. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_TORTURE_FAILURE;Several of the specimen broke as we conducted our experiments on them, and I find it hard not to consider this whole ordeal a personal failure, and apologize profusely to [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42028_HUNT;We all fought as best we could.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42028_DUEL;This fight is more than I could have hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42028_GAME;It was a brutal close match. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42028_SOCIAL;Hopefully [From.GetSheHe] had fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42028_SCHOLAR;I have learned a lot from this discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42028_STEWARD;That.. could have been worse, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42028_TORTURE;Next time it will be even better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_HUNT_SUCCESS;The beast fell to the ground from all the wounds, and all the retainers let out a loud cheer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_HUNT_FAILURE;As we think the beast is finally about to give up, it suddenly ups and charges at [From.GetFirstName], and manage to flee. No matter how much our retainers look for it, they are unable to track it down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_DUEL_SUCCESS;[From.GetFirstName] dodge several blows, before striking the last standing man several times. The two lumbering men give up, and our win is assured. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_DUEL_FAILURE;After a long tiresome fight, [From.GetFirstName] and I finally have to admit defeat to the two men. We did our best, but was outdone by their strength and speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_GAME_SUCCESS;After several hours, the last of our opponents' units finally fall. [From.GetFirstName] gives me a small nod of approval, as we sit back and enjoy our well fought victory. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_GAME_FAILURE;After several hours, the last of our units finally fall to our opponents. [From.GetFirstName] give me a small shrug, as we sit back and think about what we could have done to win. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SOCIAL_SUCCESS;It was quite the event, and as the guests are leaving the premises they are talking about how much fun they had. [From.GetFirstName] still seem to be asleep as I am leaving. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SOCIAL_FAILURE;I wake up with a massive headache, and there is barely anyone around. When I leave, [From.GetFirstName] still seems to be asleep. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SCHOLAR_SUCCESS;We slowly win point by point, both [From.GetFirstName] and I defusing every argument made by the opposing side. In the end we are the undisputed victors of the discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SCHOLAR_FAILURE;We slowly lose point by point, every argument we make turned against us. In the end, we have to yield to the opposing side, and there is no doubt we have lost the discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_STEWARD_SUCCESS;We walk for a couple of minutes, and suddenly come across the exit to the maze, where all our retainers are waiting for us. This could have been a lot worse, all things considered. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_STEWARD_FAILURE;Several hours pass, and there is no sign of the exit. Every crossroad feels like I have seen it before, and it is increasingly looking like we are going to have to spend the night in here. In the end, one of [From.GetFirstName]'s retainers come in and helps us find the way out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_TORTURE_SUCCESS;[From.GetFirstName] seems happy about all the torture [From.GetSheHe] has done. I am not entirely sure what to feel, but as long as [From.GetFirstName] considers it a success all is good, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_TORTURE_FAILURE;[From.GetFirstName] is clearly distraught and unhappy about the results of the torture. [From.GetSheHeCap] starts apologizing, though I am not entirely sure why.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42029_HUNT;I thank [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the fun occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42029_DUEL;I thank [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the fun event.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Many [settler_of_iceland_target.Culture.GetName] settlers are now flocking to its coasts, sponsored with ships and building materials by [settler_of_iceland_target.GetFullName], in search of a new life. [left_iceland_target.GetFullName] and [left_iceland_target.GetHerHis] followers have left the island in disgust, returning south to their ancestral homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_10;Rejecting what they believe to be propaganda from [GetRandomEvilGodName], followers of the [GetName] faith ignore the word of the [GetPriestTitle]s. When hearing any passage from [GetScriptureName] read out loud, they instantly stuff their ears with parsley which each follower keeps with them in a sacred pouch. In honor of [GetHighGodName], every meal during religious holidays is prepared with abundant quantities of parsley.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_11;Followers of the [GetName] religion hold the belief that every third passage of [GetScriptureName] is written by [GetRandomEvilGodName], much to the dismay of adherents to the parent religion. Fanatics often write down the offending passages on rocks, which they subsequently throw at the houses of those they perceive to be heretics or heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_12;Cold nights are cherished by followers of the [GetName] religion, who hold the belief that the touch of [GetHighGodName] is as icy as the deepest winter. As [GetScriptureName] makes no mention of this, [GetPriestTitle]s of their parent faith deem such rituals heretical and inspired by the gospel of [GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_13;The [GetPriestTitle]s of the [GetName] faith argue that their way of worship is not only the correct way, but also much older than that of more traditional believers. For millenia the [GetName] faith thrived, until a tiny sect of lunatics broke away to form new branches of the religion – or so [GetName] [GetPriestTitle]s claim. A defining feature of the faith is that the private lives of [GetPriestTitle]s must remain completely secret, which often see them wearing disguises when not tending to their flocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_14;The [GetName] faith believes that [GetScriptureName] should be available to all, and not just for the [GetPriestTitle]s to interpret. They therefore produce numerous copies of [GetScriptureName], localized into several languages. Many of these copies hold changes introduced by less than scrupulous [GetPriestTitle]s, which is a contributing reason to [GetName] followers being seen as heretical.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_15;Followers of the [GetName] faith share many similarities between themselves and those of their parent faith. In fact, [GetPriestTitle]s from both sides have been unable to find a single practical difference between the two sects – they both hold [GetScriptureName] in high regard, praise [GetHighGodName] in the correct way and fear the retribution of [GetRandomEvilGodName]. Still, followers of the [GetName] faith claim themselves to be heretics, and ardently so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_16;The [GetPriestTitle]s of the [GetName] religion often openly preach in the street and in public buildings, and are often ridiculed and spat on by those who do not ascribe to their somewhat ridiculous interpretation of [GetScriptureName]. In the minds of [GetName] worshipers, the text of [GetScriptureName] needs to be simplified to such a degree that a child could understand all of it, and they often rewrite the various passages to be comprehensible for even the most simple-minded person – something which obviously draws the ire of the more hard-line worshipers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_17;The [GetName] faith incorporates many elements of other religions. Several rites outlined in the [hindu.GetName] holy text ([hindu.GetScriptureName]) are part of everyday worship, and the behaviours of [jain.GetName] [jain.GetPriestTitle]s are emulated by [GetName] [GetPriestTitle]s. While their own holy text, [GetScriptureName], is still held in the highest regard, a lot of emphasis is put on the necessity for [GetPriestTitle]s to interpret other holy texts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_18;Those who adhere to the [GetName] faith believe that an eternal war is being waged between [GetHighGodName] and all the gods and goddesses of other religions. Followers actively support this war by carving idols of all the foreign gods, which they subsequently burn in ritualistic bonfires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_19;[GetScriptureName] can be interpreted in many different ways, or so the [GetName] faithful claim. Their [GetPriestTitle]s make many bold claims, and they often conflict – one [GetPriestTitle] might claim [GetHighGodName] to be warlike one day, while another [GetPriestTitle] claims [GetHighGodName] to be championing peace the next. Their [GetPriestTitle]s often gather in grand cabals to discuss which interpretation is the right one, which leads followers of their parent religion to often accuse them of being witches or warlocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_1;The [GetName] faith is an offshoot branch with a radically different interpretation of [GetScriptureName]. Their [GetPriestTitle]s constantly debate the validity of various passages, drawing much ire from the mainstream followers. In their interpretation of the scripture, [GetHighGodName] is overtly warlike and unsympathetic, but their practices are otherwise very similar to those of the main branch.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_20;The religious leadership of the [GetName] faith forbid anyone from reading [GetScriptureName], even themselves. They believe the texts to simply be too sacred for anyone to see – instead the [GetPriestTitle]s themselves dictate what adherents should and should not do. Their [GetPriestTitle]s also claim that anyone not following their commands will have their souls eaten by [GetRandomEvilGodName] as they die.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_2;In the [GetName] faith followers not only adhere to the teachings of [GetScriptureName], but also look to other religions for guidance. Alongside their own scripture, they also read passages from the holy texts of the [norse_pagan.GetName] and [buddhist.GetName] faiths. This practice condemn the [GetName] faithful in the eyes of many [GetPriestTitle]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_3;Followers of the [GetName] faith act and behave much like the adherents of their parent religion, though with one major difference. All religious practices are performed in reverse order, as they believe the chronology of [GetScriptureName] to have been tampered with by [GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_4;The [GetName] faith is an ultra-orthodox branch of fanatical zealots. Adherents do not tolerate any deviance from the word of [GetScriptureName], subscribing to a very literal interpretation rather than the more relaxed one of their peers. They believe this to be the only way to truly please [GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_5;For followers of the [GetName] faith, the number ten is of paramount importance. Rituals are always performed by ten [GetPriestTitle]s, every sermon touches upon ten passages from [GetScriptureName] and truly ardent worshipers pray to [GetHighGodName] ten times per day. They also believe that [GetRandomEvilGodName] is, in fact, ten separate entities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_6;Generally, followers of the [GetName] faith are much more relaxed about their rites and methods of worship than the followers of the orthodox branch. Their [GetPriestTitle]s claim that the battle against [GetRandomEvilGodName] is already lost, and that there is no path to salvation. This nihilistic outlook cause many followers to take the name of [GetHighGodName] in vain, which angers more devout worshipers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_7;Unlike the main branch, worshipers of the [GetName] faith do not believe [GetScriptureName] hold the absolute truth. Followers prefer oral traditions, where [GetPriestTitle]s travel far and wide in order to share their wisdom with other [GetPriestTitle]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_8;The [GetName] faith, unlike its parent faith, has a very strict caste hierarchy pertaining [GetPriestTitle]s. Internally, [GetPriestTitle]s are organized into five separate ranks, each owing full loyalty to their superiors. Their flocks are also organized into five separate groupings, with the recent converts and cynical worshipers being tended to by the lowest-ranking [GetPriestTitle]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_HERESY_DESC_9;Followers of the [GetName] faith are deemed cursed by adherents of their parent faith. The reason for why this belief is so ingrained and unshakable has been lost to time. The most common claim is that they are spawn of [GetRandomEvilGodName], who spit on [GetScriptureName]. Adherents of the [GetName] faith do not ascribe to this interpretation, as they themselves believe spit to be a blessed tool provided by [GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC;The [GetName] faith is as old as the world itself. Their deity, known only as [GetHighGodName], is said to have created the world for the [GetName] faithful to live and thrive in, by condition that they follow the rules set in [GetScriptureName]. [GetScriptureName] was passed directly from [GetHighGodName] to the first [GetName] prophet. Followers also believe that [GetRandomEvilGodName], and an army of dreaded heretics and heathens, seek to undo the entirety of creation and doom the [GetName] faithful to eternal darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_10;In the [GetName] religion [GetScriptureName] tells the story of [GetHighGodName] whose arm was cruelly cut off by [GetRandomEvilGodName] – the pieces of their arm became the land and their blood the sea, creating the world as we know it. Their [GetPriestTitle]s sometimes cut off parts of their own body in an attempt to be closer to [GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_11;Eons ago, all creatures were united on a single land that spanned infinitely towards the horizons. They lived under a soft light that allowed the lushest grass and the sweetest of fruit to grow. But one day, for reasons and from origins unfathomable by mere mortals, [GetRandomEvilGodName] arrived and shook the very essence of the universe, splitting the lands, scorching the earth and disuniting mortals. Nearly everything was consumed by the infinite darkness still visible at night, except for the land miraculously protected by [GetHighGodName]. The faithful have recorded the history of the world in [GetScriptureName], so they may never forget that they owe their very existence to the benevolence and power of [GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_12;In the [GetName] faith it is believed that this is the eighteenth cycle that the World has gone through. In every cycle, [GetHighGodName], protector of Life and Light, fiercely battles [GetRandomEvilGodName], feeding on Death and Darkness. As stated in [GetScriptureName], the only way to prevent [GetRandomEvilGodName] from destroying the universe and starting another cycle, is to grant [GetHighGodName] energy through specific rituals, such as always having three candles lit during moonless nights, or celebrating with family every day before, and after, a full moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_13;According to [GetScriptureName], when a person dies, their soul becomes ripe for the taking by the Reapers who will bring it to [GetRandomEvilGodName], who will then devour and assimilate them, to quench an insatiable hunger that has lasted since the dawn of time. Only burying the bodies can protect the souls and allow them to safely travel down to the Underworld, the realm of [GetHighGodName], allowing them to come back to earth as guardian spirits who help their descendants and fend off the Reapers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_14;The [GetPriestTitle]s tell of a time immemorial, when gods and mortals lived together on Earth – the latter as slaves and playthings to the first. After many sunsets, one mortal had enough of this servitude and rose against the foul gods, driving the billions of other mortals to stand with him in a fight for their freedom. In the end, the gods were driven out, repelled to the far confines of the universe, where their remains amalgamated through rage and vengeance, into what we now call [GetRandomEvilGodName]. The rebellious mortal himself was drenched in divine blood, becoming [GetHighGodName], a godlike entity, as strong as the will of all mortals on Earth. In the well protected [GetScriptureName], it says that the remnants of the evil gods draw closer to their lost realm every time a mortal indulges in corruption or decadent behavior, and that only bravery and willpower can wake [GetHighGodName] to protect reality from certain doom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_15;The [GetName] faith started a long time ago, when a hunter in a now forgotten forest followed a purple feathered bird with large wings to a glade in the heart of the woods. There [GetScriptureName] lay between five trees with golden leaves. The scripture recounted how this forest was the resting place of [GetHighGodName], an entity that had created the world at the cost of its life, after confronting [GetRandomEvilGodName]. Since then, the [GetPriestTitle]s have spread the word in gratitude of [GetHighGodName], to whom they show respect by venerating nature and by burying their dead along with the branch of a tree, allowing them to reunite with their creator.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_16;The [GetName] faith is a rather recent one, founded by the charismatic first [GetPriestTitle], who detailed in length how human beings need to follow certain strict rules of life recorded in [GetScriptureName], lest they be forever doomed to suffer eternal pain at the hands of [GetRandomEvilGodName]. As he drew close to death, the [GetPriestTitle] warned that his good followers were still at risk, due to the numerous masses of wicked heathens performing decadent rituals and increasing [GetRandomEvilGodName]'s influence. The only way he could help protect them was by discarding his mortal coil and ascend to a new form – thus he became [GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_17;The [GetName] faith is one founded upon fear – their clergy hold terrifying masses, where they recite passages from [GetScriptureName] telling of how [GetRandomEvilGodName] will crack the world open like an egg. Despite followers constantly fearing for their souls, they find brief solace in the stories told about their main deity, [GetHighGodName]. These stories are not often told, and only the most brave [GetPriestTitle]s dare recite them in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_18;It is said that the first [GetPriestTitle] was the patriarch of a small tribe who lived on boats out on the endless sea. One day, all the fish in the ocean vanished – eaten by [GetRandomEvilGodName]! Just as the small tribe was on the brink of starvation, [GetHighGodName] appeared before them. The first [GetPriestTitle] pleaded to [GetHighGodName] for salvation, and [GetHighGodName] in response created the land, the trees and all the animals of the forests so that the tribe would not starve. Grateful, the first [GetPriestTitle] created [GetScriptureName] to record all the divine things that [GetHighGodName] had created.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_19;The [GetName] religion is focused upon the practice of ritualistic hunts. All their holidays involve hunts in one form or another, with various quarry being the target of each one. In their religion [GetHighGodName] is a great hunter, and [GetRandomEvilGodName] the prey. Their holy text, [GetScriptureName], detail exactly how each hunt should be performed in meticulous detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_20;The [GetName] faith has a particular focus on funerary rites. When an elder dies, they are flayed and their skin fashioned into a religious object such as the cover of a book or a ceremonial mask. Their holy text, [GetScriptureName], tells the story of [GetHighGodName], flayed and buried a hundred times by [GetRandomEvilGodName]. Funerals are always led by at least two [GetPriestTitle]s, one who performs the flaying and one who ensures everything is done to code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_21;The [GetName] faith is one based largely upon the sense of touch, with adherents locking hands and holding each others shoulders during prayers. Worshipers frequently embrace the [GetPriestTitle]s both before and after a religious ceremony. To bless someone, a [GetPriestTitle] must embrace and lift the chosen one towards the sky – so that [GetHighGodName] may reach down and touch their souls. Their holy text, [GetScriptureName], outlines the jealousy borne by the main enemy of [GetHighGodName] – [GetRandomEvilGodName], the one who must not be touched.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_22;Temples belonging to the [GetName] faith are a spectacle to behold – covered from top to bottom in elaborate wooden carvings, every one of them looks like a work of art. It is said that a woodcarver once started to carve a face into a stump, but was interrupted halfway through. He then started carving a new face into another stump, and when he was finished it sprung to life in the form of [GetHighGodName]. The woodcarver was blessed by [GetHighGodName], and given [GetScriptureName] to keep safe. The half-carved stump he had previously abandoned then sprung to life in the form of [GetRandomEvilGodName], who proceeded to chase the carver out of the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_23;Adherents of the [GetName] faith reject the notion of individuality, believing instead that all are joined in one grand consciousness. In the center of this collective mind lies [GetHighGodName], sleeping. Stories in [GetScriptureName] claim that only [GetRandomEvilGodName] can awaken [GetHighGodName]. [GetName] [GetPriestTitle]s therefore organize a search every year, with an ultimate goal to locate the cave in which [GetRandomEvilGodName] resides.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_24;The [GetName] faithful do not believe this world to be the 'true' world. Their [GetPriestTitle]s say that it is but a shadow of the real world – a world which can only be accessed by pleasing [GetHighGodName]s every command. The rules that must be followed are outlined in [GetScriptureName], with [GetPriestTitle]s standing constant guard over where the texts are kept. They believe that [GetRandomEvilGodName] is always watching, ready to corrupt the texts as soon as they are left out of sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_25;In the [GetName] faith ceremonial dance is seen as the most important aspect of worship. Both men and women meet together to dance, preceded by a host of [GetPriestTitle]s. Song and music are always present, and the sung texts are often directly quoted from [GetScriptureName]. Their holy text, [GetScriptureName], tells the story of the great love between [GetHighGodName] and [GetRandomEvilGodName]. It is said that before their falling out, [GetHighGodName] and [GetRandomEvilGodName] danced together constantly. As they left each others side, night and day was created.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_26;Those practicing the [GetName] faith spend a lot of time deep in thought, and their [GetPriestTitle]s spend almost all their lives in contemplation. Their holy text, [GetScriptureName], contains limitless dates and countless numbers of importance, all telling their own story of the future of the world. Interpreting these numbers is a complex task, and new connections are made almost every year. It is said that the truth has been hidden behind complex formulas by [GetHighGodName]. This truth hides the secret to not being ripped apart for eternity by [GetRandomEvilGodName] in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_2;The [GetName] faith was founded when the first [GetPriestTitle] got a revelation from [GetHighGodName]. By using her own blood, the [GetPriestTitle] penned [GetScriptureName] and passed it on to her followers. Since then, many other [GetPriestTitle]s have had revelations, though all of them about [GetRandomEvilGodName] and how the world will end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_3;The foundation of the [GetName] faith is shrouded in mystery, and [GetScriptureName] does not make mention of their origins. Followers argue that the [GetName] faith has always existed, and that anyone claiming otherwise is an agent of [GetRandomEvilGodName]. Their [GetPriestTitle]s enforce this notion rather vigorously, threatening that the wrath of their supreme diety will strike unbelievers down - [GetHighGodName], riding a mighty chariot across the night sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_4;It is said that the seven prophets of the [GetName] faith stayed up for seven days and seven nights when they were revealed [GetScriptureName] from [GetHighGodName]. After the completion of [GetScriptureName], six of them were uplifted to join [GetHighGodName] while one was doomed to spend eternity with [GetRandomEvilGodName]. [GetName] [GetPriestTitle]s thus condemn the number seven.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_5;In the beginning there was only fire, and out of that fire [GetHighGodName] forged the world. The [GetPriestTitle]s of the [GetName] faithful continually write down visions they have of [GetHighGodName] in [GetScriptureName]. At times, one such story may be deemed heretical, and is subsequently burned. The [GetPriestTitle] who wrote down the offending text is often believed to be under the influence of [GetRandomEvilGodName], and is such likely to be burned alongside the heretical pages.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_6;The [GetName] faith is an amalgamation of many other religions. There are several ways which followers may worship [GetHighGodName], all of them equally legitimate. Some even worship [GetRandomEvilGodName] alongside [GetHighGodName]. It is said that somewhere in the world ten [GetPriestTitle]s guard [GetScriptureName], of which only fragments are known even to the most devout followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_7;The [GetName] faith is very strict, with [GetPriestTitle]s constantly requiring followers to cite passages from [GetScriptureName]. If a follower would fail to cite three passages in a row, they are punished and deemed corrupted by [GetRandomEvilGodName]. Fortunately [GetScriptureName] contains only twelve passages, spread out over four pages – proving the mercy of [GetHighGodName] once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_8;The [GetName] faith is very peculiar in that sermons are always sung. The [GetPriestTitle]s are picked among followers based on the tone of their voice, as their diety [GetHighGodName] is said to have conveyed [GetScriptureName] entirely through divine song. The main enemy of [GetHighGodName] is [GetRandomEvilGodName], who cannot sing. Mute people are deemed cursed by [GetRandomEvilGodName], and are often excluded from mass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ALT_START_GENERIC_RELIGION_DESC_9;The followers of the [GetName] faith believe that all the world is but a game between [GetHighGodName] and [GetRandomEvilGodName]. Due to this a lot of their religious rites and worship are centered around a complex board game, with the most successful players becoming [GetPriestTitle]s. The rules of this sacred game are recorded in [GetScriptureName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11029;My commander [home_commander.GetBestName] has been reported to perform impressively [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName]. Most recently, rumor has it that [home_commander.GetSheHe] ruthlessly decapitated an enemy commander, before immediately [home_commander.GetRidingMarching] onwards, to face [home_commander.GetHerHis] next foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11029;I think a reward is in order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11029;My [home_commander.GetRootRelation] has my gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11030;My [home_liege.GetRootRelation] [home_liege.GetTitledFirstName] is apparently thoroughly impressed by my battle technique. A missive I have received speaks at length about my bravery, and of people telling stories about the decapitation of [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11030;I aim to please.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11031;I am staring down the [home_commander.GetEnemySoldierDesc] enemy commander, trying to gauge what on earth [home_commander.GetHerHis] armor actually consists of. Are those... rat pelts? My thoughts begin to trail off and I proceed to demand [home_commander.GetHerHis] surrender. But then suddenly the world is spinning, and someone shouts: "Dodge for the flying head!".;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11032;My commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] has been slain [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName]. "Decapitated, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the courier says, shuddering. "It was [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName], from [home_commander.Society.GetName]", he continues, averting my eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11032;And you just left [enemy_commander.GetHerHim] in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11033_A;[From.GetBestName] did not appreciate the fate [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] met with at the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName], and has sworn to take matters into [From.GetHerHis] own hands. All this fuss over head on a pike?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11033_B;[From.GetBestName] must not have heard how I refused to take the head of my enemy as a trophy, because I am told that the [From.GetManWoman] has sworn to take vengeance on me, for the fate [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] met with at the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11033;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11034;On our way to the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.Capital.GetName], a huge boulder blocks our path. Having been [GetRidingMarching] for days, my muscles are aching for a real challenge. "Recruit!", I bark at a young [Root.GetBoyGirl] carrying a weapon far too big for [Root.GetHerHis] hands. "Hand me that hammer.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11034;Let's do something about this rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_11034_TT;You let your fellow commander deal with the road block.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11035;On our way through the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], a gigantic boulder blocks our path. Commander [From.GetTitledFirstName] is arguing at length with [From.GetHerHis] officers about whether we should try [GetRidingMarching] around the river crossing or not, when suddenly I hear them shouting my name, gesturing in my direction with a huge hammer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11035;Finally! Let's do something about this rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11036;[my_fellow_commander.GetTitledFirstName] is a belligerent commander, fighting with the strength of a [GetRandomMythologicalCreature].

EVTDESC_HFP_11039;Commander [From.GetTitledFirstName] keeps throwing me looks across the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], as I am [GetWeaponSwinging] my way through our enemies. Just as I begin to get uncomfortable by the surveillance, [From.GetSheHe] calls out: "Save some for me, will you?";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11037_A_1;Nostalgia comes easily in the soft light of a campfire.

EVTDESC_HFP_11037_A_2;In the light of the campfire, my men often talk about heroes of old. Last night, one of them blessed us with a fabulous tale of the battle that claimed the life of [target.GetBestName].

EVTDESC_HFP_11037_B_1;It was long ago I felt so good about being in charge of a regiment. Today, while lying in wait for an ambush, one nervous officer confessed that there was a time when the stories about my command were all over [home_capital_province.GetName]. "It's what made me vow to join the [Root.Culture.GetName] army, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [Root.GetSheHe] murmurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_B_2;I remember hearing the stories from [home_capital_province.GetName], about the command and leadership of [target.GetBestName]. "It is important to have role models", I said at the time. Today, I look out over my regiment, thankful for all the great leaders that came before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_11037_2;Now they all look to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_C_1;"No, I do not drink from the skulls of my enemies" I laugh, when one curious recruit lets slip a question about that time when I decapitated an enemy on the battlefield. [GetSkullTrophyComment];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_C_2;"If [target.GetTitledFirstName] drank from the skulls of [target.GetHerHis] enemies?" I ask. The recruit nods eagerly. I laugh, putting my arm around [Root.GetHerHim] conspiratorially: "Of course, there is a secret chamber back home in [home_capital_province.Capital.GetName], where [target.GetSheHe] is rumored to have bathed in their blood". The recruit grows pale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11050_A;I could have sworn I heard the enemy commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] barking orders, but as I search the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] is nowhere to be found. A fellow soldier finally informs me that [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] has been spotted cowering in the far back behind a [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence], and most disgracefully, behind [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11050_B;Things are going well, when suddenly I hear an embarrassed huff from nearby.

"I think [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] is trying to escape the battle, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the soldier next to me muses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_12001;"For [Root.Society.GetName]!" I proclaim, raising my glass. The cheers around the table are boisterous and the air hangs heavy with anticipation.

"For the battles to come", the [giving_member.GetManWoman] says, without further ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12005;I will make certain this is put to good use, [giving_member.GetBrotherSister]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12005;Oh, this is far too generous. I shall pay you for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_12010_A;We are camped [target_ruler.Capital.GetInOn] the [target_ruler.Capital.GetTerrain], on our way to [target_title.GetName].

EVTOPTA_HF_12010_A;A challenge! *clears throat* Hey, you! Yes, you! Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_12010_B;Having spent the evening drinking and talking around the campfire with my traveling companions, I finally bid them good night. On my way back to my sleeping spot, I pause. Nearby, leaning against a [target_ruler.Capital.GetTreeRockFence], is a [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] tending to nature's call. "An enemy!" I yell, more surprised than alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_B;Oh, excellent! I will duel this one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_B;I should just leave you be, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_C;Walking through the streets of a village in [target_ruler.Capital.GetName], the locals seem eager to point out how foreign I am. They have clearly never seen a [Root.GetManWoman] like I before, and while some are adoring my armor and confident stride, it does not take long before I encounter open hostility. "Go home!" one [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] barks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_C;You want to say that to my face? Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_C;This one looks too big for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_D;Having turned in for the night, I find myself wide awake listening to the snoring of [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName]. Just as I am about to get up and do something about my irritation, I hear a rustling in the bushes. Before I can get to my feet, I find a [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] leaning over me, eying me suspiciously, a weapon aimed at my throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_D;You come armed, I see... How about we do this one on one?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_D_TT;You challenge the scout to a duel, and the two of you meet on a moonlit field.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[fellow_member.GetFirstName] fishes a coin from [fellow_member.GetHerHis] pockets, rewarding the urchin for the information. "There [my_duel_target.GetSheHe] is!" the child suddenly cries, pointing at a [my_duel_target.Culture.GetName] [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] down the street.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_12200_A;The [target_ruler.Capital.GetRegionalBigAnimal] dead on the ground, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] braces for my attack. I call out: "For [Root.Society.GetName]!", my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] swooshing, nay, singing through the air. With the trees as our audience, and only witness to my deed, I have soon seen to [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_B;Albeit under the influence, the battle stance comes naturally to me. My opponent staggers backwards in surprise, almost tripping over the [target_ruler.Capital.GetTreeRockFence]. Before [other_combatant.GetSheHe] has time to catch up, I [Root.GetKillingBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_C;I draw my weapon, without hesitation. The crowd scatters around us and my opponent and I fall into circling one another. The ensuing fight is more even than I care to admit. At the end, I am sending a quiet prayer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], as I take in the cheers of our audience, and slam my weapon against [other_combatant.GetHerHis] head.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_D;As soon as the camp is out of earshot, my opponent draws [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon. Wind moves over the moonlit meadow, the grass bending in waves, causing it look as if the ground itself is breathing, under our feet. "This is too easy", I murmur. Then I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_E;[fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] motions for people to get out of the way, just before [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] lunges at me, indignity on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I parry immediately, defending myself well, judging by the excited cheers of our spectators. At the end of it all, the crowd has grown still, the streets flowing with the blood of their [other_combatant.Culture.GetName] warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_F;My opponent seems to be getting tired, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] moves becoming slower. Strengthened by the cheers of the crowd, I [Root.GetKillingBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_A;Charging into the glade, I am itching for a fight. My opponent simply waits, one hand resting on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon]. I draw closer, thinking this is going to be fun! The [target_ruler.Capital.GetRegionalBigAnimal] dead on the ground, I raise my own weapon, about to let out my battle cry. Then I hear the desperate roar of the animal behind me and then... nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_B;"You must be lost!" I proclaim, drawing my weapon. I sway a little, internally cursing the alcohol in my veins. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman]'s face darkens, and I swallow. A scout! A spy? My mind races. "Your liege knows we are here then?" I demand to know, but my opponent has already slashed my guts open. "You heathen drunk", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] mutters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_C;"You want me to DUEL you?", the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] mocks, rolling [other_combatant.GetHerHis] eyes. The next thing I know, I am under a furious flurry of attacks, only barely keeping up with my opponent. A young girl screams as I collapse into the crowd, bloody and unable to stand any longer. "Inform [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName], that the heathen troll is dead", is the last thing I hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_D;I hear birds. It must be dawn, I think to myself. Why does my face feel cold, my limbs frozen...? Tensing, I cannot move. What happened? We fought on a meadow, the moon was guiding me, and... I fell. That blasted scout skewered me, with [other_combatant.GetHerHis] sword. Oh [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], welcome me to your side...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_E;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] seems to be flying towards me, swinging [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon vigorously. [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] pulls a small child out of our way, and yells for the crowd to step back. My opponent's technique appears more focused on showmanship than actual swordplay, and I find myself drawn in by the spectacle. Then suddenly, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon sinks into my chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_49008;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49008;How could they!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49020;Grand Crusader;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49020;Once more [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has been at the forefront of the Crusade, single handedly bringing victory to the faith. Known throughout all the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] world as one of the most loyal and fierce [Root.Religion.GetName] there is, [Root.GetSheHe] is revered wherever [Root.GetSheHe] goes.\n\nRespect is showered upon [Root.GetTitledName] and [Root.GetHerHis] family, the legends and tales of their deeds will be brought down in history as the deciding factor of the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] victory in the face of adversity. There is no doubt the members of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty will continue bringing the lost lands into the fold of the faith, and continue to be at the vanguard of the Crusades.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49020;Crux sacra sit mihi lux.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49021;Commander of the Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49021;"Forward!" I shout as I cut down another of the men charging at me. "For [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]! To victory!"\nAt some point all my men seem to be pushed away, and I grit my teeth for the onslaught of incoming enemies. I can see their commander through the battle, sitting back on a horse with a grin on his face. If I am going down, I am bringing him with me. One cut follow another, and I see his grin slowly fade to a grimace as he tries to back out of the fight he is slowly being pulled into.\n\nI look down upon the dead commander and his retinue as the rest of the battle is settling down. "My [Root.GetLordLady], are you all right?" One of my guards comes running over, looking across my bloodied body.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49021;I am... More than all right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49101;Teutonic Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49101;[From.GetTitledName] has started planning a campaign against the pagans of the north. For too long, the pagans have been steadfast in their fights against the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s, and [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to convert them with the sword.\n\nThe wild people of the north have started gathering in response, bellowing their battle hymns and demonic rituals, unstoppable in their frenzy. Surely, this will lead to a bloodbath on both sides, as neither will let the other be.\n\nWith a final blessing from [From.RelHead.GetTitledName], the armies of the Teutons leave the south for good. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49101;By the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49101_TT;Maybe I could ask the §Y[d_teutonic_order.GetName]§! for help with my pagan neighbors?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49101;What will they think of next?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49101;Let them come, and be slaughtered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49106;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\n\n[northern_crusade_potential_target.GetTitledName] is a dangerous force to be reckoned with, and I agree with your assessment that [northern_crusade_potential_target.GetSheHe] needs to be dealt with.

EVTOPTA_HF_49106;Forward men!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49106;Wait, I need to reconsider this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49107;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nWe are ready to march our troops against [northern_crusade_potential_target.GetTitledName], but we will need monetary support for the campaign.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_49107;Wait, I need to reconsider this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49108;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI agree [northern_crusade_potential_target.GetTitledName] is a dangerous foe, and we would need a base for our campaigns against the [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49108;Forward men!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49108;Wait, I need to reconsider this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49110;Northern Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49110;The Teutonics march towards [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands, to secure it for Christianity. The pagans have had too long to convert peacefully, now they will be taken by the sword.\n\nTheir first goal is to take out [northern_crusade_target_character.GetTitledFirstName], the warlord of [northern_crusade_target_character.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]. If they secure [northern_crusade_target_character.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName], they will use it as a base to quell the rest of the [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands.\n\nThe blood of the pagans will flow through the rivers of the north, no mercy will be shown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49110;Forward, men of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49110;And so the infidels march...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49110;What will the [From.Religion.GetName]s think of next?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40013;The Principality of Antioch;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40013;The city of Antioch was originally raised by Seleucus in Alexander's time, and was under [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] control for centuries before the infidel onslaught took control of it. Finally, you have restored the ancient city to its true glory.\n\nWith Antioch back in Christian hands, it is only a matter of time before all of ancient Christendom will be returned. The rest of the world is watching, as I am the forerunner of what is to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40013;Watch as I take the Holy Land back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40014;The Kingdom of Cyprus;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40014;The island of Cyprus stands at the precipice of the Holy Land, and with its return to the fold of Christianity, the path to the Holy City has once more opened.\n\nI have raised the new banner of Cyprus for the first time, and I look east to the lands of Jerusalem and Antioch. For too long, those lands were controlled by the enemies of the cross, but no more.\n\nThis is just the first of many victories. Everything will return to [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40014;We will retake the Holy Land, one piece at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40015;Republic of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40015;For a long time the city of [Root.Capital.GetName] has flourished. Our grasp reaches across the Mediterranean, our traders rich and powerful in their roles.\n\nThe Feudal rulers of Europe has looked down upon us for centuries, but it is finally coming to an end as our potential for greatness is undisputed. The time of the old nobility is about to pass, and the mercantile era is beginning with the rise of our merchant class.\n\nWatch, my friends, my rivals, my countrymen, as I show the world the true strength of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40015;Bow down before us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40022;The [From.GetArchdukeArchduchessCap] of [k_austria.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40022;The [From.GetDukeDuchessCap] [From.GetFirstName] of [d_osterreich.GetName] has started calling [From.GetHerselfHimself] the [From.GetArchdukeArchduchessCap] of [k_austria.GetName], and over time it has become normal to accept [From.GetHerHis] superiority over the other princes and princesses of the Empire. In a grand ceremony in [From.Capital.GetName], the title has finally become official.\n\nAs one of the prime electors of the Empire, [From.GetTitledName] has proved [From.GetHerHis] superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt. The other lords and ladies of the Empire have grudgingly accepted it, looking towards [From.Capital.GetName] in envy. They will look for any opportunity to take [From.GetHerHim] down and raise their own positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40022_2;The [From.GetDukeDuchessCap] [From.GetFirstName] of [d_osterreich.GetName] has started calling [From.GetHerselfHimself] the [From.GetArchdukeArchduchessCap] of [k_austria.GetName], and over time it has become normal to accept [From.GetHerHis] superiority over the other princes and princesses of the Empire. In a grand ceremony in [From.Capital.GetName], the title has finally become official.\n\nAs one of the prime [From.GetLadiesLords] of the Empire, [From.GetTitledName] has proved [From.GetHerHis] superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt. The other inferior members of the Empire have grudgingly accepted it, looking towards [From.Capital.GetName] in envy. They will look for any opportunity to take [From.GetHerHim] down and raise their own positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40022;It is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40022;[From.GetArchdukeArchduchessCap]? What a preposterous title.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40023;The Eastern Marches;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered all the [k_bavaria.GetAdjective] and [k_carinthia.GetAdjective] lands in under [From.GetHerHis] rule, and has raised the banner of a new Kingdom of [k_eastern_marches.GetName] to celebrate [From.GetHerHis] victories. This new Kingdom has become the new defacto leader of all the old eastern marches of the Empire.\n\nThis new Kingdom in the Empire is expected to be a power to be reckoned with. The old lands of [k_bavaria.GetName] and [k_carinthia.GetName] were well known for their strength and fortitude, and it is expected the new Kingdom will be all that and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40023;Bow before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40023;An impressive feat, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40024;Byzantium restored;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40024;Once more the grand Byzantine banners of Constantinople have been raised. [From.GetDynName] has restored the old crown lands of Byzantium, and the Greek Empire rises from the ashes of defeat, to conquer its old enemies in both the east and the west.\n\nThe Eastern Roman Empire suffered defeat after defeat, finally falling to the throng of hostile states at its borders. But like the Rome of old, its enemies could not keep it from growing in power and becoming a relevant actor once more.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire is one and indivisible, all hail [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40024;I will serve the true leader of Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40024;An undeserving false Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_40024;Impressive...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_40024;Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40025;Great [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!\nIt feels me with hope and dedication towards the future, to once more see the Byzantine banners raised. If it would please you, I would do my utmost to serve you in these challenging times to come.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40025;As it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40026;I need to decide where to situate my new Kingdom. The old eastern margravates were all well known and powerful, and my decision will set certain expectations of what to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40026;[c_osterreich.GetName] and the old margravate of Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40026;[d_styria.GetName] is well known for its strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_40026;[k_bavaria.GetName] has always been the center of this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_40026;[k_carinthia.GetName] has a long fruitful history behind its name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40027;An End to the Muslim Caliphates;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40027;Since the rise of the Prophet in Arabia, the Muslim faith has been a strong independent actor throughout the lands. [From.GetTitledFirstName] put an end to that, and the Muslim faith has been shattered by the latest advances of the [From.Religion.GetName]s.\n\nIn a grand announcement in front of [From.GetHerHis] castle in [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] declared all the infidel faiths dead, and that all the previous believers would be given a choice to convert to the true faith, or fear the [From.Religion.GetName] faith as it would crush them as it did the Muslims. Nowhere is safe from the Crusaders of [e_outremer.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40027;The Holy Land is saved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40027;We have to beware the Christians...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_40027;The Christian God brings victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40029;The Order of Calatrava;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40029;The [d_knights_calatrava.GetName] is the most recent addition to the soldiers of the Cross, founded by the magnanimous [From.GetTitledName]. Working out of the old Moslem castle in Calatrava, they will be one of the vanguards against the dangers to the faith, and make sure the Iberian peninsula never again fall to heathens and infidels.\n\nThough they are willing to follow the orders of [From.GetTitledName] for now, their loyalty lies with [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] first and foremost. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40029;May their battles end in victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40029;More sheep to the slaughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40030;The Order of Santiago;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40030;This chivalric order owes its name to Santiago Matomoros, the legendary Saint appearing at the battle of Clavijo to help the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s against the Moslem infidels. The [d_knights_santiago.GetName] was formed by the benevolent [From.GetTitledName] in [From.GetHerHis] bountiful wisdom, and all its members have vowed to protect the pilgrims traveling the Way of Saint James.\n\nBlessed and sponsored by the [From.Religion.GetName] church itself, they will fight at the forefront of the struggles to keep Iberia [From.Religion.GetGroupName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40030;Brave warriors of Christ!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40030;Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_40031;The Teutonic Order;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40031;The Order of the Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem has been formed, sponsored by the [From.Religion.GetName] church and [From.GetTitledName]. The Teutonic Order primarily protect and care for pilgrims to the Holy Land, but will serve [From.Religion.GetName] rulers willing to pay for their upkeep.\n\nThough they only fight to protect the pilgrims for now, there is already ambitious murmurs in the order about what the future might bring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40031;Helfen, Wehren, Heilen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40031;The infidels come in many flavors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_41004;The Faithful Prepare for War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41004;A messenger approaches us with a letter from the Vatican, from the Vicar of Christ [From.GetHerselfHimself]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is asking us to prepare our men to fight against the heathens and infidels, to restore Christendom to the lost places of the world. \n\nThe Pope wants to send our faithful [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] men against [crusade_title.GetBaseName]. The region is held by [crusade_character.GetCrusadeReligionDescription] [crusade_character.GetTitledName], and it is time to return it to Christianity once more.\n\nThough the Pope wants to invade [crusade_title.GetBaseName], a pious [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] could convince everyone to focus on another objective that is of more value to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41004;I should consider preparing my men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41004;My men are ready! To [crusade_title.GetBaseName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41004_TT;The preparations for the next Crusade begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_41009;Crusade for [crusade_title.GetBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41009;In a grand announcement the Pope declares [crusade_title.GetCrusadeLaunchAnother]Crusade for [crusade_title.GetBaseName]. [Root.GetCrusadeLaunchFirstPart]\n\n[Root.GetCrusadeLaunchSecondPart]\n\n[From.Religion.GetHighGodName] will grant remission of sin to everyone partaking in the righteous war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41009;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41009;Those [From.Religion.GetGroupName] heathens!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41009_TT;The Crusade for [crusade_title.GetName] begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_41011;[Root.Religion.GetGroupName] Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41011;The announcement about the grand Crusade was sent to every [From.Religion.GetName] realm, but apparently to no avail. The Pope has been trying to gather up support for the Crusade for months, but now the Vatican has gone quiet, as the Vicar of Christ has given up on his Crusade.\n\nThe [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s seem more interested with infighting than fighting the heathens or infidels outside their own borders. The Crusade was officially canceled, as the Pope held a large announcement denouncing the [From.Religion.GetGroupName] Lords and Ladies for their ineptitude in the matters of Faith. Now it is only a matter of time until [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] forsakes his faithless followers, and leaves them to be conquered by the sacrilegious infidels, blasphemers and heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41011;A terrible day for all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41011_TT;The Crusade has been canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41022;Dear [Root.GetTitledName]\nIt has come to my attention you have not yet put on the cross. I have decided that it is time for you to pay back the favor you owe me, and be part of this endeavor.\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41022;I guess I will go then...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41022;I will support the Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41031;[pleased_courtier.GetFirstName] approaches me as I am on my way out, to tell me how happy [pleased_courtier.GetSheHe] was to hear I had pledged my men to the Crusade, and wish me luck in the upcoming war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41031;Thanks, I appreciate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41032;I receive a letter from [pleased_participant.GetTitledName], with a well detailed approval of my decision to join the upcoming Crusade. Maybe this is a chance to get closer as we fight the the heathens together?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41032;I appreciate the gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41032;Let us fight the heathens together!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41033;I receive a letter from the despicable [pleased_participant.GetTitledName]. As we are both going to participate in the upcoming Crusade for [crusade_title.GetName], [pleased_participant.GetSheHe] wants us to make amends and move on from our disagreements.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41033;Maybe it is for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41033;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41034;I have been unable to stop myself from being somewhat excited at the prospect of the driving away the infidels from [crusade_title.GetName], and restoring peace to those lands. I have not usually felt this inspired as a [Root.Religion.GetGroupName], but maybe I am changing?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41034;Da pacem Domine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41035_1;Knowing I will be gone for a while, I decide to spend a day with the local sea creature while I still can. It comes up with some great battle plans I can use in the upcoming wars for [crusade_title.GetName]. I am blessed to have such a good friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41035_2;I drop by the local forest, to spend some hours with the beasts and fauna before I leave home. I end up having a fruitful discussion with, well, I am not entirely sure what it is, but the conversation was enlightening!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41035;I am inspired to do my utmost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41035;An eye for your wisdom, you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41035;We will see each other again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41041;[displeased_courtier.GetFirstName] explains to me in great detail exactly how disappointed [displeased_courtier.GetSheHe] is in my decision to leave the Crusade. After the long tirade [displeased_courtier.GetSheHe] finally leaves the room, and I get some time for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41041;How dare [displeased_courtier.GetSheHe]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41041;Maybe it wasn't the right decision after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41042;I received a letter from the esteemed [displeased_participant.GetTitledName]. It seems [displeased_participant.GetSheHe] is displeased in my decision to revoke the pledge I made to the Crusade, and finds me somewhat untrustworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41042;That is none of [displeased_participant.GetHerHis] business.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41043;One of my messengers brings me a letter from [displeased_participant.GetTitledName], where [displeased_participant.GetSheHe] declares me an unreliable swine and a traitor to all [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41043;Well, I don't like [displeased_participant.GetHerHim] either!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41144;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nI have noticed that neither you nor your troops have partaken in the Crusade you pledged to join. I am disgusted that you would dare to lie about something like this, and expect your troops to show up soon.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41144;I guess... I should?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41147;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nYou have already received one warning, and clearly not taken heed. I consider your lack of faith and interest in keeping your promise to be unbecoming of a Christian ruler.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41147;[From.GetSheHeCap] does not sound pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_41045;Traitor to the Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41045;Messengers are sent to every corner of the world, as the Pope furiously excommunicates the despicable and vile [unpledging_actor.GetTitledName]. [unpledging_actor.GetSheHeCap] is expelled from the faith for forsaking [unpledging_actor.GetHerHis] fellow [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s in their righteous war for [crusade_title.GetName].\n\n[unpledging_actor.GetTitledName] should not be helped, cared for nor forgiven. A traitor to the faith as well as to the cause, the only thing [unpledging_actor.GetSheHe] deserves is to be justifiably overthrown. A true [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] would not betray [unpledging_actor.GetHerHis] allies to fight the heathens alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41045;Unfaithful and despicable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41045;What did [From.GetSheHe] call me!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41051;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI noticed you still have not pledged to the Cross. As a faithful [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] ruler, I hope and pray that you will reconsider your actions, and join in the righteous war for [crusade_title.GetName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41051;Yes, you are right your Holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41051;I need time to reconsider.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41051_TT;Not joining nor supporting the Crusade might have dire consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_41054;The Crusader [new_crusader_king.GetKingQueen];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41054;After the long fought battle for [new_crusader_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it has finally been restored to the faith. [new_crusader_king.GetDynName] has stepped up to the throne as the beneficiary of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], becoming the [new_crusader_king.GetKingQueen] of the Crusader State. Surely it will be hard to continue fighting at the fringe of Christendom, but everyone can agree [new_crusader_king.GetTitledFirstName] is the right person for the task.\n\nThe Pope requests that the rest of the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] world support this new Kingdom as best they can, and not let it once more fall to the infidels and heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41054;I wish [new_crusader_king.GetHerHim] luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41054;If only it could have been me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41057;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI know we have had our differences, but it pleases me to hear you have decided to join our rightful cause. I have made the preparations to recant your excommunication from the church.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41057;Thank you, Your Holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_41061;The [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetLordLady] in [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41061;The victories against the infidels were hard-fought, but things have finally settled down and the titles I fought for were given to [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetDynName]. It will surely be difficult to be a part of the new Kingdom, but I wish [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetHerHim] luck in [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetHerHis] future endeavors.\n\nI look back one last time as my men and I leave [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. I wonder what life would have been like if it had been me staying here, rather than [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetDynName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41061;No, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41061;Maybe in another life, it could have been me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41075;Greetings, [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI was informed the heathen Pope have declared a will to bring a Crusade to your doorsteps.

EVTOPTA_HFP_41075;I thank you, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41088;How much gold should I donate to the Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41088;I hope the Pope will appreciate this gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41088;I know just how much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41088;A grand gift befitting my station!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HFP_42305;Enraging the Masses;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42305;The bitter losses in the previous Crusade are still lingering across the Christian lands. The messengers of the Pope have traveled across all the faithful realms of the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s to spread the Crusader spirit among the people, but the nobility has tired from the previous war.\n\nWith the Pope at the forefront, small revolts have occurred as the people want to reconquer the holy places of the faith, with the lords and ladies somewhat skeptical.

It is a long and perilous path, with many challenges waiting for them.

EVTDESC_HFP_42308;[From.GetFirstName] finally had [From.GetHerHis] people stand down as the losses against [FromFrom.GetTitledName] proved to be too costly.

Peasant no more, nobody can deny [From.GetHerHis] right to the throne. For who else than [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] could have guided [From.GetTitledFirstName] to victory?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42309;The peasants won?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HFP_42310;The Faltering Shepherds;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42310;Without the guidance of [From.GetFirstName], the men and women of the aptly named Shepherds' Crusade have started to fall apart.

EVTOPTA_HFP_42310;As expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_42323;As expected, the rebellious peasants of the Shepherds' Crusade have started causing chaos among the local populace of [current_location.GetName]. My people look to me, to stop these foreign elements intruding upon our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF23811_B;This is going to be amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23812;The celebrations have finally begun. [Root.Capital.GetName] is bustling with activity: people from every corner of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have traveled here to pay their respects to me and my ancestors, exchange tales and goods, and have a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23812;Welcome all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23813;The celebrations have finally begun. [From.Capital.GetName] is bustling with activity: people from every corner of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have traveled here to pay their respects to [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] ancestors, exchange tales and goods, and have a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23813;So many new faces...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23814;A hoarse voice calls for my name from the crowd of peddlers, catching my attention. An old Seer is waiting for me sitting near an old runic stone. He claims that he will read my future for a small price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23814;An old woman suddenly jumps in my line of sight, giving me a toothless smile and shaking a cup filled with dice. She claims that she can determine what the stars have in store for me, for the right price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC23814;As I am appraising some of the merchandise of the travelers drawn to the festival, I meet the unsettling gaze of a weird boy in tatters. The kid approaches me slowly, ignoring the crowd bustling with activity around him, and whispers that he can read me my future for just a small price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23814;Here's a few coppers...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23814;I have no time for this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23815;The fortuneteller surprises me by predicting that extraordinary opportunities are about to present themselves to me in my near future, and I need only to pay close attention to find my good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23815;I always knew I was born lucky!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23816;The fortuneteller assures me that a period of good luck is just around the corner, and that I need only look for the right opportunities in order to change my life for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23816;Thanks, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23817;After giving a thorough look to the signs, the fortuneteller warns me that my future looks grim and I should be very careful about my next choices to avoid any calamity befalling upon me and my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23817;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23818;As I walk around the crowded streets of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], a strange aroma catches my attention, leading me to the obscure stand of an old alchemist. Seeing my curiosity, the man shows me some of his wares and their prodigious effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23818;A love potion, uh?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23818;How about a drink for this charm?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23818;I will burn an offering for you, in exchange for this perfume.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF23818;Never mind, I am not interested in what you sell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23819;As I walk around the crowded streets of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], a strange aroma catches my attention, leading me to the obscure stand of an old alchemist. Seeing my curiosity, the man shows me some of his wares and their prodigious effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23819;A strength potion, you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23819;How about a drink for this charm?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23819;I will burn an offering for you, in exchange for this amulet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF23819;I do not need any of this sorcery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23820;An old merchant has set up a large stand in the middle of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] this year, selling all sorts of amulets and trinkets to use at the end of the festival as offerings to the gods of our ancestors. I wonder if I should buy something to burn myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23820;The most expensive jewels are the least I can offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23820;This amulet looks expensive enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23820;If I really *have* to buy something...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF23820;I have no money to waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23821;I stumbled on [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetTitledFirstName] in the main hall with a group of other distinguished guests. I have heard quite a few good things about [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHim] in the past, and I wonder if this festival is the right occasion to earn [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHis] friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23821;Hail, [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName]! How fare you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23821;Try to become §GFriends§! with §Y[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetTitledFirstName]§!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23821;Let me offer you a drink, [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTBHF23821;Try to improve §Y[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetTitledFirstName]§!'s §YOpinion§! of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23821;Maybe some other time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23822;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I spent the evening telling old tales of our clans to each other, having a very good time alongside the other guests of [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast. I never noticed how likable [From.GetFirstName] was before...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23822;But what does [From.GetSheHe] *really* wants from me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23822;Let us become friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23822;We should do this again, sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23823;For some reason, [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] has entirely rejected my offer of friendship. I think [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHis] paranoid nature might have gotten the best of [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23823;Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23824;[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] spent a great evening in the long-house, telling old legends and drinking with the other tribesmen. When finally leaving, right before dawn, we swore an oath of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23824;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23825;[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] and I spent a very pleasant evening in the long-house, telling old legends and drinking with the other tribesmen. We left the hall at dawn, both glad to have had this opportunity to strengthen our relation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23825;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23826;I was busy exchanging tales with some of the other tribesmen, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] approaches me with a smile, offering me a drink, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to make a toast to new friendships.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23826;What?! What's your angle? Is it poisoned?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23826;Sure, why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23828;Seeing [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName] having such a good time with the other tribesmen, laughing and drinking in the long-house, is an unbearable sight. I wish I could do something to bring [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHis] insufferable merriment to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23828;This requires some planning...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23828;Try to get §Y[tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! drunk to humiliate [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23828;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTBHF23828;Openly insult §Y[tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! in front of all the guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23828;Never mind, I will just have to ignore [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23830;It looks like [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetFirstName] is smarter than [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetSheHe] looks. [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetSheHeCap] was able to see through my deception and reject my false offer of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23830;Oh well... I guess that's it for tonight then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23831;Just as I hoped, I was able to get [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName] completely drunk and isolate [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHim] from [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHis] friends. Now is the time to reveal my true intentions...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23831;Nobody is looking us...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23831;Lead §Y[tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! into the wilderness and abandon [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHim] there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23831;Shame on you! What sort of [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetManWoman] are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTBHF23831;Humiliate §Y[tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23832;[From.GetTitledFirstName] fooled me! After getting me drunk, [From.GetSheHe] abandoned me in the wilderness, in the dead of night. I am too tired and confused to find my way back to the tribe, and I think I hear something growling nearby...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23832;Who goes there?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23833;I do not understand. One moment [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I are having fun, drinking and exchanging tales, and the moment after [From.GetSheHe] is insulting me, shaming me for being nothing but a drunken fool in front of everybody.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23833;You have gone too far!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23833;Whu-? I thought we were friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23834;We were all happily celebrating our good fortune in [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s long-house, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to ruin the mood of the feast by yelling my name and showering me with insults, clearly trying to upset me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23834;These are fighting words!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23834;You are a hateful little [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23835;I have received several complaints from my guests in the last days regarding [warrior_lodge_guest.GetTitledFirstName]. Apparently, [warrior_lodge_guest.GetSheHe] has been going around town, picking fights, bragging about [warrior_lodge_guest.GetHerHis] great feats and shaming my own tribesmen for lacking in strength and courage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23835;I am sure we can solve this series of misunderstandings...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23835;Well, [warrior_lodge_guest.GetSheHe] is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23835;I will talk to [warrior_lodge_guest.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_FESTIVAL_LODGE_HERO_DISAPPROVES;§Y[warrior_lodge_guest.GetTitledFirstName]§! §RDisapproves§! of your decision;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23836;The priests are preparing a large feast to offer to our ancestors tonight. I have been spying at the servants bringing in the offerings in the great hall for some time. Some of my friends have dared me to see if I can sneak in and out under the priests' noses without being spotted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23836;I will show you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23836;Sneak inside the main hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23836;No, that would be wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23837;I am only a few step into the main hall when I hear somebody call for me. One of the priests has spotted me! With my face growing red, I manage to run away just in time to avoid being caught. My playmates welcome me with a shower of chuckles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23837;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23838;With just a bit of care, I manage to sneak past the servants and get into the main hall. The weird statues of the ancestors are all assembled near the long table, decorated with trinkets and surrounded by food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23838;*Mess up the statues' placement*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23838;*Steal the food*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23839;I was surprised to hear that the statues in the temple of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] have moved to a nefarious position. The priests wander around town informing everyone of the prodigious event for several hour before news comes out that the misplacement was just the result of [From.GetFirstName] sneaking into the temple and rearranging them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23839;[From.GetFirstName] managed to sneak into the temple and rearrange the positions of the ancestors' statues! Even better, the old priests thought that the statues had moved by themselves and went screaming around town that a terrible calamity was about to strike all of us before they learned the truth and became the laughing stock of town.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23839;That brat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23839;The gods are surely upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23839;Ah! Awesome!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23840;[From.GetFirstName] and some of [From.GetHerHis] playmates have stolen the offerings for tonight's feast of the ancestors. The priests were furious to find the little piglets sleeping in the woods near [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], surrounded by the remains of their loot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23840;[From.GetFirstName] managed to sneak inside the temple and steal some of the offerings for the ancestors. [From.GetSheHeCap] them brought them outside of town and shared them with the rest of us. We spent the rest of the evening laughing at the grown-ups wandering around the tribe, trying to understand what happened to the missing food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23840;And now we have to pay for more offerings...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23840;Sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23841;A particularly wealthy and obnoxious merchant has been drawn to town due to the great festival, and one of my playmates has challenged me to steal one of his trinkets while he is distracted haggling, to make up for all the times that he mistreated us children in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23841;I will take the biggest jewel from his stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23841;Try to steal a trinket from the merchant's stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23841;No, stealing is wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23842;Just as I stretch my arm to pick the item from the stand, the merchant grabs me by the wrist and pushes me aside, warning me to keep away from his wares. Trying again now that he has been put on alert would just be a waste of time, so I am forced to return to my playmates empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23842;What a shame...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23843;It takes just a few moments of distraction for me to snatch one of the merchant's amulets and run away in the crowd before he can even realize that he has been robbed. I return triumphant to my playmates, and we spend the rest of the afternoon looking from a safe distance the old merchant scrambling through his wares, trying to find the missing trinket.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23843;Ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23844;Today's festivities were disrupted by the complaints of a foreign merchant. The old man spent most of the afternoon claiming that one of the town's kids had stolen a precious amulet from his stand and would not leave until he received compensation for his losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23844;A particularly wealthy and obnoxious merchant has been drawn to town due to the great festival. Whenever he comes to town, he is always mean to me and my playmates, so, this year, we decided to get even with him. [From.GetFirstName] snuck behind his stand while he was distracted and stole one of his most precious trinkets, leaving the old merchant to spend the rest of the day looking for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23844;Fine. Take this money and leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23844;Serves him right!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23845;The festival has attracted many people from all over the realm to [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. Unfortunately, many of the new grownups are stuck-up bores with no good manners. I have half a mind to gather a few of my playmates and teach them a lesson...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23845;Who's up for some mudslinging?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23845;Disrupt the festival by throwing mud on some of the adult guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23845;Eh, that is just how grownups are...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23846;We have barely started having fun when a some of the tribes' warriors decide to take matters in their own hands and take on us. All my friends immediately desert me, leaving me alone to face the angry tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23846;Hemm... sorry?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23847;With just the help of a few other kids and a well-placed tree, we are able to successfully throw the entire party into disarray. People scream and run for cover, yelling our names and throwing back swears at us. When the adults finally organize to get us, we have already dispersed to laugh off the successful mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23847;We should do this again next year!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23848;I was just chatting with some of the other tribesmen in the main square of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], when something hit me on the back! Shouts and complaints swiftly follow, turning the entire square into a complete chaos. A few of the kids have climbed on a nearby tree and they have started throwing mud at the rest of us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23848;Some of the town's kids, led by [From.GetTitledFirstName], have decided to pester their parents and neighbors by throwing mud at them in the middle of the morning fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC23848;[From.GetFirstName] decided to take me and some of the other kids and get back at some of the stuck-up adults in our town by laying a trap on them during the morning fair, to cover them in mud and slush. And it was an absolute triumph.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23848;Damn those kids!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23848;You are great, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23849;All the grownups are busy, and I am bored. As I try to think of something to do, I spot [scoped_running_child_1.GetFirstName] and suddenly remember about that time [scoped_running_child_1.GetSheHe] bragged about being the fastest kid of the whole tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23849;We will see about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23849;Challenge §Y[scoped_running_child_1.GetFirstName]§! to a race around town.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23849;Actually, maybe I will just have a nap.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23850;[From.GetFirstName] challenged me to a race around town to determine who is the fastest kid of the tribe. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems very confident that [From.GetSheHe] will win and has already started to tease me that I am too much of a coward to even accept [From.GetHerHis] challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23850;Oh, you will see!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF23850;Accept §Y[From.GetFirstName]§!'s challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23850;Maybe some other time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23851;Turns out that [From.GetFirstName] was too much of a coward to pick up my challenge. [From.GetSheHeCap] has run away with [From.GetHerHis] tail between [From.GetHerHis] legs, throwing some poor excuse to avoid the race.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23851;Typical.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23852;After we gather a few playmates to act as witnesses, [From.GetFirstName] and I are off running around town, dodging servants, scaring off farm animals, zigzagging through the fields for the quickest path. Several minutes later, I jump head-first over the final line, surrounded by the cheers of the other kids.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23852;After we gather a few playmates to act as witnesses, [From.GetFirstName] and I are off running around town, dodging servants, scaring off farm animals, zigzagging through the fields for the quickest path. Unfortunately, just a few steps before the finishing line, I trip over a rock and fall to the ground, allowing [From.GetFirstName] to surpass me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23852;Yes! I won!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23852;No! I lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23854;There is an old tree at the edge of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. Kids say it is more than one hundred years old, and that sometimes the ancestors use it as a ladder to get into our world, and nobody aside from the shamans ever gets close to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23854;And I am going to climb it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23854;Sounds scary...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23855;It was not easy. Every few steps I had to stop and hold my breath, listening to the ominous creaking coming from the gray branches of the old tree. And yet, with just a bit of patience and stubbornness, I was able to get all the way to the top. There are no gods around as far as I can see, but I have a full view of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23855;*Look at the warriors training*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23855;*Look at the traders' caravans*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF23855;*Look at the servants chatting*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF23855;*Recite a prayer to the ancestors*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23856;I was almost halfway through the climbing, when an ominous creaking announced the breaking of one of the branches I was balancing a foot on. Grabbing at the air and letting out a choked squeal, I fall from the old tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23856;AAAAAHHHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA23860;After a few unintended fights and several challenges thrown amongst guests, it has been decided that the best way to appease the crowd is to organize a tournament of our best warriors. Not only there are many in the tribe excited to test their mettle in a friendly competition, the shamans have also assured me that this will be a good way to obtain the favor of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF23862;Let any strong fighter step forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23863;Many of the guests in [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s long-house have taken the habits of organizing drinking games during the great feasts we are holding almost every night to celebrate the old gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA23866;The trading brought by the great festival has refilled our stables with a large number of fine steeds. Some of them less tame than others.

To entertain [great_tribal_festival_host.GetHerHis] guests as well as to discipline the most turbulent of [great_tribal_festival_host.GetHerHis] stallions, our host has decided to issue a horse-taming competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23867;No steed can resist me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23867;I will cheer on the tamers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23868;Some of my advisors and shamans suggested me that it would be a good idea to entertain my guests by issuing a friendly competition during this period of festivity, aimed at finding who is the fairest in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23868;Why not? I am certain to win.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23868;I will be glad to judge all candidates...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23869;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] advisors have come up with the idea of organizing a beauty contest during this year's celebration, allowing entries from all of the guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23869;Perfect! I cannot wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF23869;I'd rather judge than be judged.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA23876_A;The crowd quickly assembles in the town square as the first contenders find their place in the fighting ring.

EVTDESCHFB23876_A;A long line of tribesmen sit one next to each other, slamming their tankards on the table and loudly inciting the few contenders to keep drinking, one cup after the other.

EVTDESCHFA23880;I hold down the last opponent for a few moments still, making sure to ensure my victory before standing up to the cheers of all the tribesmen. As the last [Root.GetManWoman] standing, I am the undisputed winner of the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23880;Anybody else want more?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23881;With a final strike, [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] pushes me on the ground, painfully holding me down until I am forced to admit defeat. I have managed to win several fights during the course of the tournament, only to have the final victory stolen from me by this [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23881;Curse you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23882;The fights go on for the entire day. When the sun sets, only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] remains standing: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName].

EVTOPTAHF23882;[tribal_festival_winner.GetSheHeCap] deserved it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23883;I need one of the servants to help me stand after the final drink. My vision is blurry and I can barely form a coherent thought, but, hearing my name being cheered on by the other guests makes me fairly confident that I have managed to win the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23883;Why is everyone spinning?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23884;I hold off as much as I can, but, in the end, I find myself on the ground, covered in mead and spit. I feel as if somebody is striking my skull with a hammer and barely manage to understand anything that is happening around me, but I clearly hear the name of [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] being repeated over and over by the other tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23884;Ughh...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23885;One by one, the contenders tap out, either falling asleep on the ground or stumbling away from the long-house with disgruntled mumblings. There is only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] who is left standing at the end: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]. The tribesmen raise [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] up and parade [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] across the hall, chanting [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF23885;Good on [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23886;I throw away the last bone and let out a long sigh, looking at the pile of plates beside me. There is a moment of silence as my only remaining opponents falls down, followed by the cheering of the crowd. Some of the tribesmen try to raise me up, but, after a few failed attempts, they decide to just pat me on the back instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23886;Ugh- I need to lay down...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23887;I manage to keep eating long after most other contenders have tapped out, but, unfortunately, as much as I try to, I am unable to keep up with [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] and, in the end, I have to concede [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] victory, and slide back on the hall's bench, sore and reeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23887;I feel awful...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23888;One by one, the contenders tap out, either rushing outside, or falling on the ground reeling.

EVTDESCHFA23889;The stallion falters and stops resisting, and I lead him on a slow trot near the line of tribesmen witnessing me in silence. When I dismount, I am welcomed by some cheering, but only after about an hour of discussion the group decides that I had proven myself to be the fastest and most resolute amongst the tamers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23889;It was a good game.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23890;Despite avoiding any embarrassing fall, by the end of the day most of the tribesmen who witnessed the contest come to the conclusion that I was not firm and fast enough to deserve to win the tournament. The honor is instead bestowed to [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23890;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23891;During the course of the day, the crowd is presented with several embarrassing falls from the various contenders. Only after getting rid of the least skilled tamers the real competition can begin. By the end of the day, after a bit of squabbling, most of the tribesmen come to the conclusion that [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] has proven to be the most competent horse-tamer of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23891;Unfortunately, I have barely started to take control over my steed when I am thrown off the saddle and land on my back.

EVTOPTAHF23891;It was fun while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23892;My looks and pose are absolutely impeccable throughout the day. It comes as no surprise when the judges selected for the contest proclaim me to be the fairest [Root.GetManWoman] in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. I walk past the other contenders, ignoring their deathly glares and politely thank the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23892;You are all too kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23893;I was so close to winning. I really thought the judges had taken a liking on me. Unfortunately, at the end of the day it is [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] the one to be celebrated as fairest [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23893;I was so close...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23894;The contenders parade one by one through the main hall, for all to see and comment upon, and, little by little, the tribesmen chosen to pass judgment on them start picking the best.

EVTDESCHFA23895;My poem captivates everyone in the long-house. It is thrilling and passionate, featuring epic battles and tragic romances, and leaving everyone holding their breath. Once I conclude my performance, there is little doubt that the prize for best bard of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] will go to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23895;This contest was but a formality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23896;My poem leaves quite a few mouths hanging, and seems to receive a very good reaction from the guests. Unfortunately, when [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] starts telling [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] story, it becomes clear to me that I will not be the winner of this contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23896;[tribal_festival_winner.GetSheHeCap] is so enthralling...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23897;The contest gives us the opportunity to hear many new amazing stories. Tales of love and war to captivate all the people of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].

EVTOPTAHF23897;I had never heard that story...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23898;My voice immediately captivates everyone in the long-house. Not one whisper interrupts my performance, the entire room listens in complete silence. Once I stop singing, I am showered with praise, and immediately proclaimed the winner of the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA23899;My song leaves quite a few mouths hanging, and seems to receive a very good reaction from the guests.

EVTDESCHFA23900;The contest provides everyone with a very pleasant evening centered around music. Exciting, upbeat pieces alternate with heart-wrenching poems, but nobody amongst the many contenders manages to move the crowd as [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName], whose voice rightfully earns [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] the title of best singer of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA23901;It was an exhausting task. At the end of the day I can barely see straight and I have only little feeling left in my fingers, but the result was far worth all the pain it caused me. My tapestry was acclaimed as the undisputed best piece of artwork anyone in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] has ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23901;I need to rest now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23902;I work as fast as I could, but, by the end of the day, I am forced to leave my tapestry unfinished. Despite several of my tribesmen praising my work, its imperfection doomed it to lose the competition to [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]'s masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23902;So much work in vain...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23903;Of the many tapestries created today none is as marvelous as [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]'s.

TT_EVTOPTAHF25200;Challenge §Y[arm_wrestling_opponent_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! to an arm-wrestling match.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25200;[arm_wrestling_opponent_2.GetFirstName] looks like a fitting opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTBHF25200;Challenge §Y[arm_wrestling_opponent_2.GetTitledFirstName]§! to an arm-wrestling match.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25200;I'd rather not risk embarrassing myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTCHF25200;Challenge §Y[arm_wrestling_opponent_3.GetTitledFirstName]§! to an arm-wrestling match.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25200;On second thought, I will go take a drink instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25201;Many important warriors have gathered in the Lodge tonight in order to celebrate a recent hunt. I have barely joined some of my friends in the festivities when [From.GetTitledFirstName] barges in, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is twice as strong as I am and challenging me to an arm-wrestling match to prove it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25201;You are on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25201;Accept §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!'s challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25201;I am too tired right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTBHF25201;Refuse §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!'s challenge.\nYour fellow §YWarriors§! will remember this cowardly act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25202;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was too much of a coward to meet my challenge. [From.GetSheHeCap] excused [From.GetHerselfHimself] and left the hall in a hurry rather than test [From.GetHerHis] strength against mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25202;Pathetic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25203;[From.GetFirstName] and I sit one in front of the other, preparing ourselves for the game. We put our arms on the table while a third fighter holds our fists still. The crowd around us chants a disjointed countdown, and cheers as we start pushing against each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25203;Hnnnngh!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25205;Slowly but surely [arm_wrestling_fighter_2.GetFirstName] is gaining ground. Inch by inch, [arm_wrestling_fighter_2.GetSheHe] is pushing my fist closer and closer towards the table. I am starting to lose breath, my face is red and covered in sweat, yet I still cannot manage to push back against [arm_wrestling_fighter_2.GetHerHis] grip. I might simply not be strong enough to win this match...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25205;Slowly but surely [arm_wrestling_fighter_1.GetFirstName] is gaining ground. Inch by inch, [arm_wrestling_fighter_1.GetSheHe] is pushing my fist closer and closer towards the table. I am starting to lose breath, my face is red and covered in sweat, yet I still cannot manage to push back against [arm_wrestling_fighter_1.GetHerHis] grip. I might simply not be strong enough to win this match...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25205;*Sneakily slide your elbow*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25205_A;*Wink charmingly at [arm_wrestling_fighter_2.GetFirstName]*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25205_B;*Wink charmingly at [arm_wrestling_fighter_1.GetFirstName]*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25205;*Lean forward and smile*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25205;Wh-what's that behind you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTDHF25205;Try to increase your chances by cheating.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25205;I must try anyway!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25206;For a while, it seemed as if victory was assured. I was slowly pushing [From.GetFirstName]'s hand closer and closer to the table. Yet, all of a sudden, [From.GetSheHe] has started to gain back ground, getting [From.GetHerHis] hand back up and starting to push on the opposite side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25206;Do not move your elbow, cheater!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25206;How is [From.GetSheHe] doing it!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25206;Wha-?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25209;Slowly but surely, I manage to push [From.GetFirstName]'s hand closer and closer to the table. I grit my teeth and chuckle, glancing at my opponent to revel in my imminent victory. [From.GetFirstName] looks back at me with a smile. [From.GetSheHeCap] is leaning forward, trying to push back, and giving me a good view of her sweaty cleavage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25209;Slowly but surely, I manage to push [From.GetFirstName]'s hand closer and closer to the table. I grit my teeth and chuckle, glancing at my opponent to revel in my imminent victory. [From.GetFirstName] looks back at me with a smile and winks at me, making my heart skip a beat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25209;Not interested!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25209;I only care about my beloved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25209;Pfh! You have picked the wrong person!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25209;I... uhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25209_A;*Stare intently at [From.GetFirstName]'s breasts.*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25209_B;*Lose yourself in [From.GetFirstName]'s dreamy eyes*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25212;Things are not looking great for [From.GetFirstName]. I am slowly managing to get [From.GetHerHis] knuckles on the table, despite [From.GetHerHis] best efforts to push my hand back. When [From.GetSheHe] suddenly shouts a semi-coherent warning about something dangerous behind me, I am baffled.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25212;Do you think I am that stupid?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25212;What!?! What is it?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25215;With a loud thud, I slam [wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetFirstName]'s fist against the table, earning a shower of cheers from the other warriors gathered around us. My opponent glares at me and mumbles something about accepting defeat as [wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetSheHe] rubs [wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetHerHis] hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25215;What sort of weakling are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25215;§Y[wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetTitledFirstName]§! might challenge you to a §YDuel§! for insulting [wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25263;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! might challenge you to a §YDuel§! for insulting [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25215;Do not be too hard on yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25216;With a loud thud, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetFirstName] slams my fist against the table, earning a shower of cheers from the other warriors gathered around us. As if defeating me wasn't enough, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetSheHe] starts mocking me openly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTYHF25216;I will show you who is stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25216;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25216;Your fellow warriors laugh at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25217;With a loud thud, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetFirstName] slams my fist against the table, earning a shower of cheers from the other warriors gathered around us. Luckily, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetFirstName] decides to not rub in [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetHerHis] victory, and gives me a bit of praise for holding on this much against [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25217;I need to train more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25218;It has been some time now since I have begun noticing [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has distinguished [From.GetHerselfHimself] more than once amongst the members of our Lodge, to the point that I have started feeling strangely attracted to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25218;I wonder if [From.GetSheHe] feels the same...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25218;Approach §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! and declare your feelings for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25218;Just a passing fancy, surely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25219;Tonight, just as I was about to leave the main hall, I was approached by [From.GetFirstName], one of my fellow warriors. After chatting for a while, [From.GetSheHe] reveals to me that [From.GetSheHe] has been watching me for a while, and finds me to be a very strong and attractive fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25219;And I happen to think the same about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25219;Thanks, but I am not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25220;I was right to trust my feelings. [From.GetFirstName] was surprised and happy to hear of how I felt about [From.GetHerHim] and told me that [From.GetSheHe] was merely waiting for the right opportunity to reveal [From.GetHerHis] own feelings for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25220;Interested in some late-night training?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25221;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] has spurned my advances without much thought to it. At first, I hoped that [From.GetSheHe] was simply misunderstanding my intentions, but, after a bit of discussing, [From.GetSheHe] flatly told me that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTYHF25221;How dare you reject me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25221;I should have known...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25222;It has been some time now since I have begun noticing [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has distinguished [From.GetHerselfHimself] more than once amongst the members of our Lodge. [From.GetSheHeCap] is, without a doubt, an impressive warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25222;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25222;Approach §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!, offering [From.GetHerHim] your friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25222;Not as impressive as me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25223;Tonight, just as I was about to leave the main hall, I was approached by [From.GetFirstName], one of my fellow warriors. After chatting for a while, [From.GetSheHe] reveals to me that [From.GetSheHe] has been watching me for a while, and has come to consider me one of the most valuable members of the Lodge, as well as a terrific fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25223;Thanks. I feel the same about you, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25223;That is very flattering of you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25224;[From.GetFirstName] was glad to hear of what I think of [From.GetHerHim]. We spent most of the night talking and ended up declaring our friendship to each other after a long series of toasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25224;I couldn't ask for a better friend, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25225;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName]'s reception to my thoughts about [From.GetHerHim] was tepid at best. We talked for a while, but it soon became clear that we do not have as much in common as I initially thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF25250;Many warriors have gathered in the great hall tonight. The dinner has just started, and I already feel eager to test my mettle against one of them. It has been some time since we had a good Flyting, and there are plenty of candidates known for their crude manners and their sharp-tongue for me to choose from.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25250;I will settle for nobody less than our best speaker!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25250;Challenge §Y[flyting_potential_opponent_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! to a contest of dialectics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25250;[flyting_potential_opponent_2.GetTitledFirstName] looks like a good match for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTBHF25250;Challenge §Y[flyting_potential_opponent_2.GetTitledFirstName]§! to a contest of dialectics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25250;I just want an easy fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTCHF25250;Challenge §Y[flyting_potential_opponent_3.GetTitledFirstName]§! to a contest of dialectics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25250;Maybe some other night...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25251;Right in the middle of a dinner, [From.GetTitledFirstName] calls from my name from the other side of the dining hall, standing on one of the long tables. [From.GetSheHeCap] challenges me to a Flyting, encouraging me to stand up and prepare myself to be thoroughly humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25251;We shall see about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25251;Accept §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!'s challenge and begin the §YFlyting§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25251;I am not in the mood right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25252;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to refuse my challenge. Muttering some poor excuse about not being in the mood for insulting anyone, the [From.GetManWoman] shrinks back in the crowd, amongst the derision of all the other warriors in the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25252;Pffh! What a coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25253;[From.GetTitledFirstName] takes a last drink and throws away [From.GetHerHis] tankard. [From.GetSheHeCap] stands up in front of me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is ready to turn me in the laughing stock of [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25253;Go ahead, then! I will let you start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25254;I stand up and shout [From.GetFirstName]'s name in the dining hall, catching many warriors' attention, and challenge [From.GetHerHim] to a Flyting. Now I only need to decide what subject will cut deeper under [From.GetFirstName]'s skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25255;[Root.GetProwessInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25255;How dare you say that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_FLYTING_INSULT_LOST_PATIENCE_REACTION;You lose your patience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25255;As if I cared...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_FLYTING_INSULT_MILD_REACTION;[From.GetFirstName]'s words barely affect you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25255;I think my accomplishments speak for themselves...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25255;Oh, I wouldn't know about that, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25255;I have no idea what you are talking about!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_FLYTING_INSULT_AVERAGE_REACTION;You hear the crowd snickering at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25257;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls from my name from the other side of the dining hall, standing on one of the long tables, challenging me to a Flyting. [Root.GetCharacterInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25257;[Root.GetCharacterInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25257;Shut up! Shut up immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25257;I have no problem admitting my flaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25257;But I am not like that at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25257;How dare you say it! That's not my fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25259;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls from my name from the other side of the dining hall, standing on one of the long tables, challenging me to a Flyting. [Root.GetAccomplishmentsInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25259;[Root.GetAccomplishmentsInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25259;Meh, not that I care either way...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25259;What does that mean?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25259;Oh, we shall see about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25261;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls from my name from the other side of the dining hall, standing on one of the long tables, challenging me to a Flyting. [Root.GetFamilyInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25261;[Root.GetFamilyInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25261;How dare you! Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25261;As if I cared.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25261;This is so mean of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25261;Isn't this supposed to be a game?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25262;[Root.GetFamilyInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25262;How dare you! Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25262;As if I cared about what you think.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25262;This is so mean of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25262;Isn't this supposed to be a game?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25263;We spar with words for a while, but soon [From.GetFirstName]'s face grows red with rage and embarrassment, surrounded by the laughter of the other warriors. Unable to put together a coherent response, my opponent has clearly lost the Flyting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25263;Stop being such a child!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25263;It was all in good fun, [From.GetFirstName], do not be mad!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25268;I lost my temper. Seeing that I was unable to rebuke [From.GetFirstName]'s insults, the crowd quickly sided with [From.GetHerHim] ensuring [From.GetHerHis] victory. As if it weren't enough, [From.GetFirstName] continued mocking me, even after I admitted defeat, reveling in shaming me for my loss!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTYHF25268;I will make you eat those words!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25268;This is it! From now on, we are enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25268;The other warriors laugh at you as you storm out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25268;Enough of this stupid game!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25269;I lost my temper. Seeing that I was unable to rebuke [From.GetFirstName]'s insults, the crowd quickly sided with [From.GetHerHim] ensuring [From.GetHerHis] victory. At the very least, after I admit defeat, [From.GetFirstName] calms me down and orders a drink for both of us, ensuring that it was all done in good fun and it was not [From.GetHerHis] intention to seriously offend me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25269;Well, too late for that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25269;The other warriors mock you for your pettiness as you storm out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25269;If you say so...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25270;Perhaps I shouldn't have treated [From.GetFirstName] so poorly. Right after the game, [From.GetSheHe] swore revenge for [From.GetHerHis] humiliation and stormed off the main hall, amongst the laughter of all the other warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25270;Can the [From.GetManWoman] not take a joke?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25271;Despite my show of kindness, [From.GetFirstName] refused to drink with me after the game. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] swore revenge for [From.GetHerHis] humiliation and stormed off the main hall, amongst the laughter of all the other warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF25280;The Drinking Contest;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25280;Our cellar has had a growing excess of mead for a few weeks now, to the point that I am starting to think about challenging the other warriors of the Lodge to see whom amongst them has the toughest stomach, while at the same time freeing some space and improving the fighters' morale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25280;Why not? Let the celebrations begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_EVTOPTAHF25280;Hold and oversee a §YDrinking Contest§! amongst your fellow warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25280;That seems like such a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25281;[From.GetBestName] has decided to share a few barrels of mead to the entire congregation tonight, challenging [From.GetHerHis] fellow warriors to see which one among us will be able to drink the most without faltering.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25281;I shall be the one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25281;Accept §Y[From.GetFirstName]§!'s challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25281;I'd rather avoid the headache instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25283;Several recruits accepted my challenge at the mere mention of free mead and soon the main hall is filled with cheering and clashing of tankards. The servants bring in the first barrel while everybody finds a place in the long table, eager to start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25283;Do not worry, there is more than enough for everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25283;You keep track of the contenders and wait for the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25284;Several recruits accepted my challenge at the mere mention of free mead and soon the main hall is filled with cheering and clashing of tankards. The servants bring in the first barrel while we all find a place in the long table, eager to start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25284;Come on! Start pouring already!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25284;You begin drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25286;The first warriors have just started tapping out when a scuffle between two of the contenders quickly devolves into a large brawl. When the dust settles, there's barely anyone left standing, and most of the mead has been spilled on the floor, making it very hard for me to determine if there is any winner at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25286;It was a fun evening at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25287;The first warriors have just started tapping out when a scuffle between two of the contenders quickly devolves into a large brawl. When the dust settles, there's barely anyone left standing, and most of the mead has been spilled on the floor, making it very hard for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to determine if there is any winner at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25287;Ugh, well, at least it was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25288;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I cannot see straight anymore and everything is blurry, but I am still standing. Unfortunately, so is [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_2.GetFirstName], and [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_2.GetSheHe] looks far more resilient than me right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25288;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I cannot see straight anymore and everything is blurry, but I am still standing. Unfortunately, so is [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_1.GetFirstName], and [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_1.GetSheHe] looks far more resilient than me right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25288;There must be a way to get ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25288;Try spilling most of your drink at each new round.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25288;I am made of tougher stuff than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTBHF25288;Focus your energies entirely on winning the match.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25288;I have to try at least!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25289;With most of the other warriors having tapped out, it looks like it is down to [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_1.GetFirstName] and [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_2.GetFirstName]. The two contenders are drinking face to face for some time, when I start noticing that [From.GetFirstName] has started to spill a suspicious amount of mead at each new round.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25289;Eh, I will allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25289;Ignore §Y[From.GetFirstName]§! cheating.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25289;Stop right there!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTBHF25289;Expose §Y[From.GetFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25290;When [From.GetFirstName] shouts my name, for a moment I think I have won the game. Unfortunately, this is not the case at all. [From.GetSheHeCap] has discovered my trick and called me out on it. Before I can try to explain myself, two warriors grab me by the arms and throw me out of the main hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25290;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTAHF25290;Your fellow warriors will remember your slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25291;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I cannot see straight anymore and everything is blurry, but I am still standing. All of a sudden [FromFrom.GetFirstName] calls for the name of my opponent, there is a bit of a scuffle, and I am proclaimed winner. I am not exactly sure what happened, but I can hardly complain about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25291;Yes! I *hic* won!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25292;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I cannot see straight anymore and everything is blurry, but I am still standing. I gulp down another tankard and watch mindlessly as my last opponent falls head first on the table. While I am still processing what happened, I am proclaimed the winner of the contest amongst the cheers of the other warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25292;Yes! I *hic* won!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25293;One by one, the contenders tap out, throw up, or pass out, leaving lesser and lesser warriors still drinking. At the end of the evening, there is only one left: [From.GetFirstName]. The crowd cheers a few times for the winner and carries [From.GetHerHim] around the hall for a while, giving [From.GetHerHim] some much needed praise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25293;A determinate [From.GetManWoman] like [From.GetHerHim] is the kind of ally I need!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25293;I really like that [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25293;I will honor [From.GetHerHis] victory with a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25293;[From.GetSheHeCap] earned a bit of praise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25294;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I am just about to raise my hand and drink another mouthful of mead when everything goes black. When I finally come back to my senses, one of the other warriors informs me that [WL_drinking_contest_winner.GetBestName] was the one to win the contest in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25294;Wait, for how long was I out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25295;Despite my best efforts, [WL_drinking_contest_winner.GetFirstName] is relentless, drinking tankard after tankard, leaving me well behind in the match. In the end, I am unable to even raise my arm to drink anymore, and lean on the table, conceding [WL_drinking_contest_winner.GetHerHim] victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25295;I just want rest my eyes for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25296;Once the other warriors have finally put me down and left me to cope with the more unpleasant consequences of my victory, [From.GetBestName] [From.GetHerselfHimself] approaches me to offer [From.GetHerHis] congratulations. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetSheHe] was truly impressed by my resilience and would love to count a [From.GetManWoman] like me amongst [From.GetHerHis] allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25296;Why not? Sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25296;Bah! I do not need *you*!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25297;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] was not interested in my offer. I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] even understood what I was asking of [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] current state. But then again, perhaps it was a silly idea in the first place...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25297;I should think these things through more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF25298;Bah! You are not *my* friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25299;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] was not interested in my offer of friendship. I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] even understood what I was asking of [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] current state. But then again, perhaps it was a silly idea in the first place...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF25300;Once the other warriors have finally put me down and left me to cope with the more unpleasant consequences of my victory, [From.GetBestName] [From.GetHerselfHimself] approaches me to offer [From.GetHerHis] congratulations. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetSheHe] was truly impressed by my resilience and as a show of respect wishes me to have some of [From.GetHerHis] spoils from a recent raid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Yet, as [scoped_pope.GetSheHe]  raises little [baptizing_child.GetFirstName] for the crowd to see, there is no cheering to drown the child’s crying.

EVTDESCDHFP20800_HAUGHTY_GROOMED_ED;[From.GetFirstName] is obsessed with [From.GetHerHis] looks. [From.GetSheHeCap] often avoids playing with other children just for fear of getting [From.GetHerHis] clothes dirty or ruin [From.GetHerHis] hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_HAUGHTY_GROOMED_RESP;[From.GetFirstName] has scolded me for being so skittish. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that I should stop worrying about my looks so much and spend more time playing instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEHFP20800_ROWDY_UNCOUTH_ED;[From.GetFirstName] spends all day playing in the dirt and never seems to care about [From.GetHerHis] own looks, not even during formal occasions, when a proper decor would be expected from a [From.GetBoyGirl] of [From.GetHerHis] stature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_ROWDY_UNCOUTH_RESP;[From.GetFirstName] has warned me that I should take greater care of myself, and that is unbecoming of a [Root.GetTitle] to always be dirty and uncouth as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHFP20800_BROOD_UNCOUTH_RESP;[From.GetFirstName] scolded me about my lack of grooming. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that, regardless of my cloistered lifestyle, I should still strive to maintain the dignified look of a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25403;But it's so boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25404;I have noticed that, since joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], my [new_recruit.GetRootRelation] has been avoiding [new_recruit.GetHerHis] responsibilities as a [new_recruit.GetTitle] to focus entirely on martial arts. If it keeps going like this, [new_recruit.GetSheHe] will soon be unfit to even administer a pig farm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25404;War is more important.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25404;This will not do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25405;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have had very little time to think of my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], what with all the training I have been going through. Still, learning to fight is certainly more exciting than hearing tedious complaints from peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25405;That stuff was always boring...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25406;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have had very little time to think of my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], what with all the training I have been going through. Unfortunately, this does not sit well with [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has ordered me to find the time both to train in the art war and statesmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25406;But stewardship is so boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25407;I have noticed that, since joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], my [new_recruit.GetRootRelation] has spent barely any time at court, learning to act as [From.GetHerHis] rank demands. Being in contact with all these coarse fighters is making [From.GetHerHim] adopt mannerisms that are unfitting of [From.GetHerHis] stature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25407;As long as [From.GetSheHe] learns how to fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25407;I won't have [From.GetHerHim] grow into a thug!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25408;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have spent very little time at court. Not that I mind, of course. The place is filled with boorish snobs and entitled sissies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF25409;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have spent very little time at court. Not that I mind, of course.

[From.GetSheHeCap] claims that I should learn how to deal with my vassals and subjects as my title demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25409;But why?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25410;I have noticed that all of this focus on physical activity might be dimming [From.GetFirstName]'s mind. My [From.GetSonDaughter] has been ignoring many of [From.GetHerHis] other studies and responsibilities to better refine [From.GetHerHis] combat skills, openly belittling their importance compared to the art of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25410;But a smart fighter is a good fighter, [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25410;I wouldn't have it any other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25411;Today, [From.GetFirstName] took some time from [From.GetHerHis] responsibilities to scold me about what it means to be a warrior. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks that I am focusing too much on the physical aspect of my training, and that I should know it takes both a strong body and a strong mind to make a good fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25411;I guess so?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25412;The past few months I have been focusing entirely on my training with [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], and the effects are showing. And all I had to do to become so strong was to neglect all my other studies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25412;Books are for weaklings!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25413;I could not fail to notice how joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] seems to have roughened up my [GetFromRelation]. The training [From.GetSheHe] is going through is undoubtedly getting results, but it is also turning my clean, handsome [GetFromRelation] into a coarse, foul-mouthed fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF25413;As long as it's making [From.GetHerHim] stronger...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25414;Today, [From.GetFirstName] took some time to scold me about my training. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that spending so much time with uncouth riffraff is making me lose my manners and forgo any care about my looks, an behavior unfitting for a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF25425;Ever since my [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] forced me to join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], life has been a constant torment for me. I am a [Root.GetManWoman], my place is not on the field of battle, needlessly risking my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25425;Ever since my [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] forced me to join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], life has been a constant torment for me. All of this talk of duels and war is too much for me to bear. I do not really have the stomach to be a fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25425;[recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation], I do not want to be a warrior anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25426;My [GetFromRelation] has confronted me today about my decision to have [From.GetHerHim] join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that the art of war does not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be a scholar instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF25811;Do not worry, I know just who to call...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25811;What sort of joke is this? Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF25811;I am afraid we have no men to spare on hopeless quests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25812;Ever since the ragtag army of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName] has reached [Root.Capital.GetName], I have received no shortage of complaints from [child_outraged_priest.GetTitledFirstName] regarding how heretical this Crusade is, and how I should make an example of its young leader to prevent my subjects from falling to [childrens_crusade_leader.GetHerHis] sinful words.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25812;But [childrens_crusade_leader.GetSheHe] is the chosen of Our Lord!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25812;Worry not, [child_outraged_priest.GetFirstName]. I will make these pesky children disappear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25812;I will have my guards beat them out of [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF25812;Let us not concern ourselves with them, shall we?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25813;Ever since the ragtag army of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName] has reached [Root.Capital.GetName], I felt drawn to the words of its leader. Jesus surely speaks for [childrens_crusade_leader.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25813;I must join [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25813;But wars are too scary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25814;Tragedy has struck me! My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], swayed by the words of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName], has decided to flee [From.GetHerHis] home to join the Children's Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814;I must follow them to protect my [GetFromRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814_A;Will I ever seem [From.GetHerHim] again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814_B;How could [From.GetSheHe] do this to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814_C;I have a [GetFromRelation]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF25815;The Unmoving Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25815;[From.GetFirstName] claimed that the tides of the Mediterranean Sea would split open at the arrival of [From.GetHerHis] army, allowing [From.GetHerHis] warriors to cross unscathed and march all the way to the Holy Land.\nUnfortunately, the Lord did not fulfill the promise made to the young Crusader, and now the large force of peasants and children languishes in Genoa, looking for a way to travel to Asia.\nSome of the less determined members of the Crusade have already lost their faith, but [From.GetFirstName] remains strong in [From.GetHerHis] conviction, persuading new, hopeless recruits every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25815;They could use more troops for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25815;I will allocate some resources to help them buy a passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25815;I can spare some money to send them some food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25815;I will pray that they soon find a passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25815;They are still in time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF25816;The Coasts of Achaia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25816;After having finally managed to book a passage through the Mediterranean Sea in order to reach the Holy Land, the Children's Crusade has been forced to an unfortunate detour to Greece after their ships crashed on the coasts of Achaia after a terrible storm. Reports from the army are scant, although there are rumors saying that many have started to doubt [From.GetFirstName]'s leadership. \n\nAnd yet, this unlikely horde of youths and peasants is still marching on towards Jerusalem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25816;They are surely in need of more supplies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25816;I must reiterate my support to strengthen [From.GetFirstName]'s authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25816;I will dispatch letters to the local authorities to send them on the correct path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25816;I can only hope they will persevere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25816;Perhaps the Lord does not wish them to reach the Holy Land...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF25817;The Children at Nikaea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25817;Despite all adversities and many attempts to undermine [From.GetHerHis] divinely-inspired leadership, [From.GetFirstName] has been able to march [From.GetHerHis] army all the way to Nikaea. \nWith the Holy Land finally within reach, the Crusaders' resolve has been strengthened. Their leader is certain that the infidels will not dare to raise their arms against them once they realize their holy mandate, and instead will open the doors of Jerusalem at their very arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With my help and God's blessing, [From.GetSheHe] is certain of victory against the abominable heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25817;When the time comes, I will join in battle with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25817;I will allocate more resources to support your fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25817;I can only offer you my most sincere prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25817;There is not much else I can do, I fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25817;How are they still going?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF25818;The Angels in Antioch;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25818;After receiving a vision of the Archangel Gabriel, who helped [From.GetHerHim] lead [From.GetHerHis] army through the treacherous path leading to Outremer, the children of [From.GetFirstName] have miraculously managed to reach Antioch before being spotted by the infidels.\nIn spite of the [From.GetBoyGirl]'s claim that the infidels would forsake the Devil upon their very arrival without the need for a fight, the heathens occupying Jerusalem have begun mobilizing their army, ready and eager to slaughter the innocent souls marching against them, in order to protect their ill-gotten land.\nThe world will soon see whether [From.GetFirstName] was truly blessed by the Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25818;[From.GetSheHeCap] does not stand alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25818;[From.GetFirstName] will not fight this Crusade alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25818;My prayers go with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25818;Those poor, foolish souls...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25819;It appears that whatever impetus had driven so many to follow [From.GetFirstName] has dissipated. The Children's Crusade is no more, its army scattered and broken, its main supporters dead or missing.\nThe leader [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName], still convinced to be the messenger of the Lord, is now derided by most as a raving lunatic who spends most of [From.GetHerHis] days yelling at people from street corners, lamenting about the depravity of the Church and the nearing end of our world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25819;And [From.GetSheHe] showed such promise...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25819;It was bound to happen sooner or later.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25823;Facing against the concrete threat of a heathen army, the Children's Crusade shattered in a thousand crying pieces.\nWithout proper leadership, equipment, or trained soldiers, [From.GetFirstName] was unable to stand against [From.GetHerHis] foes. Despite being able to lead [From.GetHerHis] followers all the way to the Holy Land, [From.GetHerHis] dreams of a Christian Jerusalem will go unfulfilled.\nAbandoned by most of [From.GetHerHis] supporters, the [From.GetBoyGirl] has been sold into slavery, alongside many other children captured by the infidels after their defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25823;A sad yet inevitable fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25824;An insane child, clearly under the influence of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], has managed to reach Jerusalem at the head of a large army of beggars and youths, claiming that it is [From.GetHerHis] sacred duty to retake the Holy Land in the name of [From.GetHerHis] god.\nWhile the number of gullible fools who have fallen for this [From.GetBoyGirl]'s words is alarming, the idea that a mob of starving peasants will be capable of defeating a mighty [Root.Religion.GetName] army in open battle is laughable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25824;We will slaughter them like lambs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25825;Facing against the concrete threat of a heathen army, the Children's Crusade shattered in a thousand crying pieces.\nWithout proper leadership, equipment, or trained soldiers, [From.GetFirstName] was unable to stand against [From.GetHerHis] foes. Despite being able to lead [From.GetHerHis] followers all the way to the Holy Land, [From.GetHerHis] dreams of a Christian Jerusalem will go unfulfilled.\nThe heathens slaughtered all of the adults who were foolish enough to follow [From.GetHerHim] and captured the children in the army, selling all of them as slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25825;Such a tragic yet predictable end...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25826;As was expected, the fools who entrusted their lives in the hands of a child were promptly slaughtered by the armies of the faithful.\nThis Crusade against Jerusalem was bound to be short-lived and one-sided. Our enemies had no skilled commanders, no weapons, no armors, no siege engines, no food... That they were able to reach their destination in the first place was something of a miracle by itself.\nThe few survivors amongst the children have been sold into slavery, never to return to their homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25826;There could be no other end to this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25827;I can no longer deny it! God is with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25827;This is impossible!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25828;I wish for [From.GetHerHis] reign to be long and prosperous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF25230_B;My attempt to change the regular die with a weighted one did not pass unnoticed. After a bit of squabbling, [random_society_winner.GetBestName] manages to pick the die away from me and throws it on the table a few times, revealing my intent and calling me a cheater.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25230;Alright, here is your money...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25230;How about we consider it even?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25230;I will make it up to you in some way, I promise!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25232_B;Unfortunately, I was too indiscreet with my leg, and several warriors noticed my attempt to move the die after it was cast. After a bit of squabbling, I am forced to accept defeat and recognize that [random_society_winner.GetBestName] has won the bet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25233_B;Despite the other warriors not noticing me kneeing the table, fate played me for a fool and I ended up accidentally pushing the die away from [Root.GetWLDieBetName], much to my disappointment. [random_society_winner.GetBestName] smiles triumphantly, crossing [random_society_winner.GetHerHis] arms and demanding me to pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25235_B;A moment of silence falls upon our group as the die rolls from my hand and bounces a few times on the table, rolling to a halt to show the face of [Root.GetWLDieName]. As the realization catches [random_society_winner.GetHerHim], [random_society_winner.GetBestName] cheers triumphantly, immediately asking me for [random_society_winner.GetHerHis] money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25236_B;After the money from the first bets exchanges hands, I pick up the die and cast it again, trying to throw it exactly in the same way.

As soon as [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] has recovered enough to stand up, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHe] thanks me profusely for saving [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25615;I let [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] walk past me as I watch the sun set beyond the leafage of the dark forest we have reached in the search of the great wolf. [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] keeps [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerselfHimself] close to me, comforted by the presence of a fellow hunter by [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHis] side, and hopelessly unaware that the terrible beast that [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHe] was set to slay was me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25615;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] and I have been out in the wild for several days now, with no trace of our quarry.

EVTOPTAHF25617;At least I tried!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25618;There are only a few rays of sunlight lingering over the forest's leaves when I am startled by the coarse howling of a wolf. I have barely the time to look around when the beast emerges growling from the foliage, its gray, sparse mane sprinkled with dried up blood, its yellow eyes staring me with soulless hatred.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25618;When the shrieking battle cry of the eagle pierces my eardrums, making me startle, I am halfway through climbing a large rock formation. An imposing shadow sweeps over the uneven surface of the wall, aimed straight in my direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25618;It is hard to tell what time is it, with most of the light blocked by the skeletal branches of the dead trees, but it cannot be too far from sunset when a threatening growl breaks the silence around me, announcing the arrival of a large brown bear.

EVTDESCDHF25618;I am following the last set of tracks through a patch of tall grass, when a sudden rustle makes me suddenly stop. I cautiously glance on my left side, and immediately spot the fiery golden eyes of the lion. The beast, crouched on the ground with its jaws half-open, looks ready to pounce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I land the final blow through the wolf's skull, pushing the creature on the ground, finally vanquished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25620;I manage to wound one of the eagle's wings as it takes off, leaving the beast unable to flee. The eagle screeches and leaps furiously towards me, its talons grasping for my eyes, but I am able to push it away while taking only a few scratches. As the bird clumsily tries to take flight, I throw my spear through its chest, bringing it down for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25620;When I charge the first strike, the bear's response is sluggish, but, the more I poke at it, the angrier the beast gets. Its hide is thick, so much so that I can barely pierce through it. Yet, I do not discourage myself, maintaining enough distance from my foe to avoid its attacks, hitting it repeatedly until it finally falls dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25620;I barely escape the lion's pounce. Just as I slide past the jumping beast, I push my spear through its chest, getting pulled alongside it. The monster roars and claws at me, trying to get rid of the weapon, yet I keep a strong hold on it, pushing it further into the lion's flesh while avoiding its attacks, until the creature finally lays dead beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25621;The fight to slay the great eagle will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come.

EVTDESCCHF25621;The fight to slay the great bear will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come.

EVTDESCDHF25621;The fight to slay the great lion will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly skewered me on multiple occasions during its desperate struggle, yet I was able to ignore the pain and focus on my assault, and finally manage to plunge my spear through its eye and put an end to its wicked existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The wolf grabs my arm within its jaws and drags me on the ground, shaking its head violently. I scream and punch the creature with my free arm, until it finally releases me. When I finally retake my senses and push myself up, soaked in my own blood, there is no trace of the wolf left.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The eagle's talons grab hold of my clothes, pulling me away from the cliff. I struggle and try to hit the beast, loosening its hold, but not before dooming myself to a harsh fall. When I finally awake, the great eagle is long gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The bear tramples me in its charge, slamming me against one of the dead trees. I scramble for my spear, and manage to throw it at the beast's head, causing it to falter for a moment. The bear roars and runs away, disappearing in the forest. Unfortunately, the beast's attack was devastating, to the point of making me unable to continue my pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The lion pounces me, crushing me under its massive weight, its terrible jaws snapping at my throat. By plunging my spear underneath its leg, I am able to stop the beast's assault and slip away. My counterattack was enough to make the lion retreat back in the tall grass. Sadly, my wounds prevent me from pursuing my quarry any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25622;We were so close...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25623;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The wolf grabs my arm within its jaws and drags me on the ground, shaking its head violently.

EVTDESCDHF25623;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The lion pounces me with unfathomable speed, slamming me on the ground and quickly closing its jaws around my neck. The creature's teeth swiftly crush my windpipe, leaving me to drown in my own blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25624;Just as the wolf is about to strike, I swiftly push [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] directly into the beast's jaws, quickly turning around and running for my life as my companion is horribly mangled by the monstrous creature.

EVTDESCBHF25624;I duck as the eagle passes over me, and let myself fall on [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName]. My companion's body dampens my fall enough to make me stand up immediately after reaching the ground and run away as fast as my legs can take me, leaving behind myself both the terrible monster and [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName], cursing me for my cowardice as the beast already circles over [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF24034;The Perfect Knight;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24034;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has risen as a shining example of knightly virtue that will not soon be forgotten.\nA paragon of gallantry and valor on the battlefield as well as at court, [Root.GetSheHe] is living proof that ruthlessness and deceit are no requirement to excel on the field of battle. With a pure heart filled with the glory of Our Lord and an unwavering discipline, tempered by countless battles and tournaments, the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has triumphed over [Root.GetHerHis] enemies time and again, inspiring many young [Root.GetMenWomen] to follow in [Root.GetHerHis] footsteps and sing of [From.GetHerHis] legendary feats.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24034;To protect the innocent and defend the defenseless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24035;The Warlord from [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24035;Scarcely any ruler bordering [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] sleeps well at night, tormented by the dreams of conquest of their terrible neighbor. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has carved a blood-soaked path through the lands of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], earning the fame of a ruthless and fearsome warrior.\n None is safe from [Root.GetHerHis] reach, and it is hard to say if [Root.GetHerHis] thirst for conquest will ever be satisfied. A cunning and relentless commander, [Root.GetSheHe] has overseen countless victories on the battlefield and acquired immortal glory for [Root.GetHerselfHimself] as well as all [Root.GetHerHis] descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24035;War and glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24036;The Philosophy of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24036;By emulating some of the greatest and wisest Kings of old, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has achieved a perfect balance between wisdom and grit, becoming both a scholar and a warrior, and applying the vast depths of [Root.GetHerHis] knowledge to lead [Root.GetHerHis] armies to countless victories and earn eternal glory for [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty.\nFew people can claim to have accomplished as much as [Root.GetSheHe] has within their lifetime, excelling both in spiritual and political disciplines to such an extent. \n[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s name will surely be remembered in many legends by future generations as that of a respected and fearsome warrior-philosopher.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24036;Clarity of mind and firmness of intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24038;The Heavenly Child of [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24038;With the child having ascended to the throne at such an early age, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s inheritance was initially perceived by many as the beginning of a period of instability and fear for the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Instead, the child [Root.GetTitle] ushered a new era of peace and prosperity throughout [Root.GetHerHis] realm, ruling firmly and kindly, and showing a wisdom far beyond [Root.GetHerHis] years.\nMost of [Root.GetHerHis] subjects now praise [Root.GetHerHim] for [Root.GetHerHis] enlightened rule, claiming that [Root.GetSheHe] must have been blessed by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24038;A mere child led [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24039;Through my considered and cautious leadership, I have been able to maintain my realm at peace, both from external and internal threats, ensuring security and prosperity for all my subjects. Few rulers can claim the same dedication as I have shown, forsaking the lure of conquest to protect their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24039;It is my solemn responsibility to keep them safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24039;Rejoice! We will share our wealth with everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF24041;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has risen as a symbol of peace and prosperity for all the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nThrough diplomacy and intimidation, [Root.GetSheHe] has managed to maintain [Root.GetHerHis] realm at peace for as long as most people can remember, enriching both [Root.GetHerselfHimself] as well as [Root.GetHerHis] subjects.\nRather than waste lives and wealth after elusive victories on the field of battle, [Root.GetSheHe] has decided to share [Root.GetHerHis] riches with [Root.GetHerHis] subjects, in an endless cavalcade of feasts and fairs that have earned [Root.GetHerHim] the love and reverence of many people in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24041;Life is short, let us celebrate!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24042;The Great Architect;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24042;The wonders of carpentry and engineering for the benefit of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24043;The Realm of Stone;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24043;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s tireless efforts in the construction of new fortifications aimed at the defense of [Root.GetHerHis] realm have immortalized [Root.GetHerHis] name as an ingenious and considerate planner.\n[Root.GetSheHeCap] has populated many of the hills of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] with impregnable embodiments of [Root.GetHerHis] wondrous technological ingenuity, projecting a sense of safety to all [Root.GetHerHis] subjects.\nFor some time now, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has acquired a reputation as a realm of towers and stone walls, secure from even the wildest horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24043;A strong defense is the best guarantee for safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24044;The Consecrated Realm;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24044;In an unparalleled show of devotion, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has dedicated [Root.GetHerHis] life to the construction of sacred monuments honoring the glory of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\nScarcely any town within [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is beyond walking distance from a sanctuary of some sort, and every major city in the realm has come to host the majestic sight of a great cathedral.\nSeveral members of the clergy have celebrated [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s virtuous projects on multiple occasions, and the [Root.GetTitle] has become a symbol of craftsmanship dedicated to heavenly pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24044;Through our works on Earth we are rewarded in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24045;The Bloodhound of [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24045;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s name has become synonymous with war and mayhem.\nDriven by an insatiable thirst for blood and conquest, this [Root.GetManWoman] is said to possess both the ferocity of a lion and the cunning of a fox, pursuing [Root.GetHerHis] mad ambitions with no concern for mercy and honor.\n[Root.GetHerHisCap] infamous exploits and the vile tactics with which [Root.GetSheHe] has achieved many victories on the field have stained [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24045;Victory above all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24046;The Silent Realm;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24046;Through [Root.GetHerHis] just and considerate rule, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to maintain [Root.GetHerHis] realm in a state of peace and prosperity for several years.\nDespite being a distant and cold ruler, the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has had a reign surprisingly devoid of malignant rumors or dissident factions.\nMost people assume that this is but the natural consequence of a wise [Root.GetManWoman] being in charge, yet an unspoken sense of uneasiness appears to loom over the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24046;A peaceful land, a quiet people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24047;The Great Builder;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24047;A patron of the crafts, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has brought unparalleled fame to [Root.GetHerHis] family with [Root.GetHerHis] unfettered patronage of countless enterprises, overseeing the construction of new temples, castles and entire cities all across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nThanks to [Root.GetHerHis] wise investments, the realm's wealth has been increased beyond measure, and for this [Root.GetSheHe] is sure to be remembered for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24047;A name as durable as the foundations of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24048;The bones beneath the pillar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24048;Sacrifices must be made when creating something great.\nNo one more than [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has exemplified this concept during the course of [Root.GetHerHis] bloodied realm.\nThe [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is celebrated as the founder of many marvels of modern architecture, yet [Root.GetSheHe] is also associated with several violent deaths and sinister plots.\nIt has become a common saying for the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] that any new building ordered by the [Root.GetTitle] is yet another tomb where [Root.GetSheHe] will hide the remains of [Root.GetHerHis] next victim.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24048;Blood cements stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF24056;The Benevolent Ruler;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24056;It has come to my attention that many of the realm's laws handling petty disputes are old and obsolete. Revising our legal system to provide fair and satisfying judgment will certainly improve the conditions of my subjects and increase the prestige of my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TT_EVTOPTAHF24056;By acting fast and investing the most amount of resources, you will found a §YBloodline§! much sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TT_EVTOPTEHF24056;Stop pursuing this path to found your own §YBloodline§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24057;The great legal reform of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is finally reaching its conclusion, yet new issues seem to have stemmed by my undertaking. There is a growing concern amongst the nobility that these new laws are too lax and might encourage peasants to avoid their responsibilities and acquire seditious tendencies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24057;I will address their concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24057;We must be patient in this transitory phase of the reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24057;Perhaps my reform is too extensive...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24057;I will try to address their concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24057;Better to scrap the entire reform then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24058;By revolutionizing the legal system of [Root.GetHerHis] realm, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has enshrined [Root.GetHerHis] name as that of a wise and benevolent ruler, ready to hear the plight of [Root.GetHerHis] subjects and administer justice with a firm but gentle hand.\n[Root.GetHerHisCap] dedication to equity and virtue have undoubtedly ensured [Root.GetHerHim] a place by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s side and earned [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty a spot in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24058;Kindness is its own reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24059;The Roots of [Root.GetHerHis] legend;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24059;My dynasty has a large and proud history, yet I am sure by looking through the realm's records I will be able to find even more prestigious ancestors to adorn my family tree and increase my prestige and legitimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24059;Might be small, but I am sure that if I look hard enough through the realm's records I will be able to find enough prestigious ancestors to adorn my family tree and increase my prestige and legitimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24059;I will lead the research myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24059;I will hire an entire group of scholars!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24059;I can ask to my immediate relatives about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24059;I can try researching myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24059;This is simply too much work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24060;Researching prestigious ancestors has helped me considerably to polish the reputation of my family, yet it is not enough. For our name to be remembered, we must endeavor to maintain a higher standard of behavior and class even today, despite our large numbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24060;Researching prestigious ancestors has helped me considerably to polish the reputation of my family, yet it is not enough. For our name to be remembered, we must endeavor to maintain a higher standard of behavior and class even today, especially given the small size of our dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24060;Each member of this family must be a paragon of nobility!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24060;I will dedicate my entire life to this venture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24060;We must all do our part to immortalize our name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24060;I will try to dedicate more time to grooming...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24060;I have greater responsibilities to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24061;Thanks to the restless efforts of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has risen to fame amongst their peers as paragons of nobility and class.\n[Root.GetTitledFirstName] [Root.GetHerselfHimself] has become a symbol of parental responsibility and familial duty. A sophisticated [Root.GetManWoman] who has devoted [Root.GetHerHis] entire life to uphold the honor and virtue of [Root.GetHerHis] family's good name, [Root.GetSheHe] has become an example for all esteemed aristocrats to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF24061;Family over all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24062;A realm of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24062;In order to make [Root.Capital.GetName] a center of theological discussion, I must invest some resources to find notable scholars, acquire treaties of past theologians and build the infrastructure needed to host both. It will not be an easy or cheap endeavor, to be sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24062;I will lead the search myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24062;No price is too big to accomplish this holy quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24062;A few notable scholars will be enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24062;I will try to lead the search personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24062;I did not think this task would require such costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24063;Since I have started recruiting scholars and expanding the religious significance of my court, there has been a growing concern from the more conservative elements of the realm's clergy about the possibility that my research might undermine pre-existing religious practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24063;I will need to discredit these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24063;The findings of my scholars will speak for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24063;I will divert some resources to reassure the opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24063;These people are simply envious of my achievements!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24063;I dare not upset the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24064;For a realm of integrity and virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24065;The Patron of the Arts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24065;In order to attract artists and philosophers to [Root.Capital.GetName] I need to offer patronage and protection, as well as make sure that my court is an open space for free thinkers, one where they are able to express themselves and research new concepts without risk of punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24065;I will personally reorganize the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24065;We will spare no expenses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24065;I should make known that artists are welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24065;I will try to make the court a more welcoming haven for artists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24065;This task is too taxing for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24066;Now that artists are finally starting to populate [Root.Capital.GetName] in great numbers, it is time for me to fund their activities and provide the books and materials they need to operate their craft.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24066;I will lead the construction efforts personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24066;A grandiose new library is what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24066;A large workshop should provide them with what they need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24066;I will host the best amongst them in my court permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24066;This is all well beyond my limited resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24067;Having spent years of [Root.GetHerHis] reign sponsoring artists and philosophers within [Root.GetHerHis] realm, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has become famous as an enlightened patron of the arts, celebrated in poems, paintings and ballads all throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.\nKnown as a learned and charming personality, the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has become the archetype of the philosopher [Root.GetKingQueen] of [Root.GetHerHis] age, a protector of all that is beautiful and metaphysical.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24067;Art merely imitates the perfection of our world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24068;The sword of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24068;My path to eternal fame is clear. By cleansing my realm of all the impure, heretical influences that plague it and consecrate it to the glory of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24068;My subjects must understand the depths of their depravity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24068;All the priests [Root.Religion.GetName] must fall in line with my quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24068;I will find sympathetic voices amongst the priesthood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24068;The people will know of my great plans!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24068;This might be too risky to try...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24069;Everywhere I turn I see a new abominable product of heresy. Licentious poems, grotesque paintings, works of fictions trivializing the tales of our holy texts and confusing the common folks of [Root.Capital.GetName]. I must put a stop to all this degeneracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24069;I will lead the inquisitors myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24069;All activities must be overseen by the righteous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24069;A few new inquisitors will correct the flock.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24069;I will exile some of the worst offenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24069;These measures might create too much discontent...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24070;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has become notorious for [Root.GetHerHis] staunch approach towards religion all throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. At the head of an endless host of inquisitors and overseers, [Root.GetSheHe] has slowly replaced all the most peaceful members of the clergy within [Root.GetHerHis] realm with uncompromising fanatics. With their help, [Root.GetSheHe] has taken upon [Root.GetHerselfHimself] the holy task of cleansing all heretical inclinations from [Root.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24070;Our lands must be purified!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24071;The Iron [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24071;It has come to my attention that several old laws issued by less forward-thinking rulers than I are still plaguing the judicial system of our realm, imposing undue limitations to my authority as [Root.GetTitle]. How am I supposed to accomplish anything worthy of note when I am bound by the leftovers of a time long since forgotten?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24071;I will revise the legal system myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24071;I will hire scholars to look at and revise these laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24071;I will try to revise the legal system myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24071;My council will deal with this in due time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24071;These laws must have been created for a reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24072;Ever since I started my legal reform, I have had an increasing series of people, petty noblemen and peasants alike, pestering me about the changes I am making to our laws. They claim that the reform is motivated by selfish motives, that I only wish to accumulate power and tyrannize over my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24072;No matter, these dissenters will soon disappear...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24072;A couple of burned villages will send the right message.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24072;I will hire some mercenaries to guarantee impartiality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24072;Their complaints are clearly irrelevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24072;Very well. I do not wish to risk a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24073;In [Root.GetHerHis] greedy lust for power, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has turned many of [Root.GetHerHis] past followers away while losing [Root.GetHerselfHimself] into spiral of selfishness and tyranny.\nHaving lost any care [Root.GetSheHe] might have had for [Root.GetHerHis] subjects, [Root.GetSheHe] has focused [Root.GetHerHis] entire attention in accumulating more powers under [Root.GetHerHis] title and celebrating [Root.GetHerHis] alleged accomplishments as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF24200;The Blood of Alexander;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24200;Legends about Alexander the Great and his epic campaign across Asia are told throughout the known world. Countless young rulers have wasted their lives in their hopeless attempts to emulate the immortal achievements of this legendary figure.\nHaving died young, after fathering only one child, Alexander was unable to establish an imperial dynasty, despite his many accomplishments, tragically dooming his Empire to fall shortly after its creation.\nRulers of all creeds and nations claim to trace their ancestors to the fleeting line of Alexander, yet none have been able to have such a prestigious claim be recognized by their peers and subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TT_EVTOPTAHF24200;Attempt to forge a claim to §YAlexander's Bloodline§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24200;It would be a fool's errand to try.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24201;The Tomb of Alexander;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24201;The location of the hallowed grounds where the great conqueror was put to his final rest has been a contested topic for millennia. Many Roman Emperors of old have claimed to have visited the tomb of Alexander during their rise to power, yet its true location still eludes modern scholars.\nThe recovery of my ancestor's sacred remains would surely strengthen my claim to his bloodline. As [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I am closer than most contenders to the most likely locations, yet wasting time and resources in a quest that many have already failed to accomplish in the past might not be the wisest course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Yet wasting time and resources in a quest that many have already failed to accomplish in the past might not be the wisest course of action, especially given how far my expedition would have to travel to reach the most likely locations of the tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF24201;This search is taking too much of my time and resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_EVTOPTCHF24201;Abandon your quest to claim §YAlexander's Bloodline§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24202;No sooner Alexander had passed on that his generals had already started fighting for possession over his body. They knew that the one amongst them who became guardian of his remains would be acclaimed as his true successor.\nAnd in the same way, I am certain that by ensuring the recovery of Alexander's body my claim to his ancestry will be stronger than any upstart [Root.Culture.GetName] ruler. Having already spent several weeks consulting the most learned scholars in the realm to gather more information regarding the tomb's possible locations, it is now time for me to invest in a proper expedition to uncover the ancient sepulcher.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF24203;Forging the Ancestry;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24203;Historians agree that Alexander had a son, named after him, born of a Bactrian Princess, yet the life of this child is shrouded by mystery. The Empire he was supposed to inherit from his father had long been split amongst greedy warlords by the time Alexander's son became a man, making it impossible for him to succeed.\nFearing retaliation from the Diadochi, it is no surprise that Alexander's wife would flee from his army and hide the child from assassination attempts.\nIt is not so far-fetched to think that their descendants found refuge to [Root.Capital.GetName] eventually, and split into the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].\nMy scholars only need to find the right references in the ancient accounts of my dynasty to uncover this prestigious link.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24203;I will provide you with everything you need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24203;No scroll must remain untouched.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24203;I will have the court library expanded to accommodate new books.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24203;Surely, a few more papers will be enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24204;The valiant members of my expedition have finally returned to [Root.Capital.GetName].\nThey bring a marvelous gift with them: a mummified corpse, covered in ancient jewels that they claim to belong to my distinguished ancestor.\nAfter a long consultation with my scholars, who carefully examine every detail of the body, I am certain that the expedition has been successful.\nAfter having been lost for so many centuries, the body of Alexander the Great has finally been found, and I am the one responsible for its recovery. The only thing that remains for my claim to Alexander's ancestry to become unobjectionable, is to make this news known throughout the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24204;Send out every messenger, inform every crier!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24204;Everybody must know of this great discovery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24204;I should make sure all my subjects know of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24204;An official statement should be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24205;The valiant members of my expedition have finally returned to [Root.Capital.GetName].\nUnfortunately, they do not bring much with them. A few rusted jewels and fragments of a skulls, which my scholars quickly dismiss as too recent to belong to the great conqueror.\nDespite the alleged care and efforts that they put into their search, my men were unable to succeed, wasting a considerable amount of my time and resources for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24205;We must try again! That tomb must be somewhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24205;Forget the tomb, we will pursue another path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24205;I have been ruined enough by this foolish venture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24206;It took us countless sleepless nights spent reading ancient tomes and pursuing forgotten scrolls, but we have finally achieved our goal. Under my lead, my group of scholars has been able to trace a lineage from the earliest known members of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty and the most plausible line of descendants of the glorious conqueror himself.\nThe only that is left now is to validate my claim in the eyes of my peers and subjects.\nMany envious upstarts are sure likely to dismiss my findings, jealous of my illustrious ascendancy. I will need to make sure that their voices are drowned out in the celebration for this momentous discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24207;Despite all the sleepless nights, hundreds of researched scrolls and learned scholars, my efforts to find a link between my dynasty and Alexander's unknown descendants has been fruitless.\nSurely, a man that has traveled so far and wide, that has achieved so much during his brief life and earned eternal glory would not allow his glorious line to die out.\nAnd a dynasty as powerful as mine, who has risen to hold the most esteemed throne of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] must surely trace its ancestry to the great conqueror himself.\nWhy is it then so hard for me to find the link between us?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24207;Maybe I should focus my attention on Alexander's tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24207;We just need to look harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24207;Enough, I give up!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24208;The Heir of Alexander;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24208;After years of study, research and investment, I have finally achieved my goal and eternally bound my dynasty's name to one of the greatest conquerors of known history.\nLong after I am gone, people will look at my descendants in awe and tremble at the very thought of meeting them on the field of battle.\nWithin our veins flows the same strength that subjugated Egypt, the same genius that cracked Babylon, the same ambition that led one man to travel from the heart of civilization to the edge of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24208;Eternal glory awaits us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24209;Despite my best efforts, my peers have yet to recognize the legitimacy of my claim to Alexander's ancestry.\nEven worse, my own subjects have reacted with apathy and skepticism to the news about my dynasty's prestigious founder. My councilors believe that the people are simply too ignorant to understand the importance of my discovery, while my peers are merely envious of its implications.\nFor one reason or the other, my quest is not over yet. My claim will have no value for as long as it is not universally recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24209;We need more celebrations and exposure!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24209;The voice of the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will be heard!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24209;There must be a way to educate those peasants...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF24210;The Heir of Alexander;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24210;There have been many rumors about [From.GetTitledFirstName] recently.\nUsing the help of charlatans, sorcerers and grave-robbers, the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has fabricated a ludicrous claim to Alexander's the Great dynasty. Many rulers have made such ludicrous assertions in the past, trying to latch onto the glorious name of the ancient conqueror, yet none had been taken seriously, until now.\nBy associating [From.GetHerHis] family to Alexander, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has succeeded in increasing enormously the prestige of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24210;How can people fall for such a blatant fabrication?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Under his lead, all of India was unified and at peace.\nOf all the dynasties who hopelessly wasted their lives trying to emulate his accomplishments, mine was the closest to succeed.

EVTTITLEHF24224;Ashoka's Humility;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24224;Ashoka's father may have been an Emperor, but his mother was a common woman, the daughter of a poor Brahmin, and he was but the last of a large litter of Princes.\nAlthough in time he arose far above his station, outshining both his siblings and his old father, it is only thanks to his humble beginnings that Ashoka was able to rule with justice and kindness over the many people of India, achieving harmony between our various creeds and customs.\nIf I am Ashoka's new form, then I must remember the low beginnings of my previous life and share his humility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24224;Let us talk of his story one more time, wise ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24224;If I were proud, would I submit myself to your judgment?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHF24224;Of course! I am the most humble [Root.GetTitle] ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24225;Despite my many attempts to convince them otherwise, the Brahmins are not satisfied by my display of humility. They claim that my demeanor betrays the inner smugness of somebody born within the highest echelons of nobility, somebody that has no knowledge nor memory of hunger and anonymity.\nA few of them are convinced that my very desire to be recognized as the heir to Ashoka is proof enough of my unbridled pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24225;I understand your concerns, but let us discuss the matter further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF24226;Ashoka's Charity;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24226;According to legend, Siddhartha Gautama was the first to predict the coming of Ashoka. The Gift of Dust, the story holding his prophecy, tells of a time when Ashoka, born as Jaya in one of his previous lives, saw Buddha wandering the streets of his village while playing in the mud. The child, taken by his desire to offer something to the wanderer, threw a fistful of dirt in the Tathagata's bowl.\nBuddha, moved by his gesture, predicted that Jaya would be reborn as Ashoka, Emperor of all India.\nThe Brahmins state that, in order to be acknowledged as Ashoka's new form, I will need to prove that I am just as charitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24226;Behold, wise ones, the girth of my munificence!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24226;Oh, yes, I understand what you mean, wise ones...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF24226;I suppose I could make a show of charity...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24226;I imagine a second fistful of dust will not be enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24227;The Brahmins are not satisfied with my show of charity.\nThey claim that merely giving some gold to the less fortunate is not enough to prove the true purity of intent that Jaya showed when he met Buddha. When Ashoka's past form had almost nothing, he was still driven to share what little he had to a complete stranger.\nThey say that my display is vacuous at best in comparison as the gifts that I am giving to my subjects I will take back in time as their [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24227;I shall give more than they could ever repay me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24227;Perhaps it is you who require some of my charity?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF23760;Being a good [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle] is no easy task. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] expect me to be a just and competent ruler. By neglecting my duties, I would only betray the loyalty of my subjects, and jeopardize the longterm stability of this great realm of ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23760;The [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] is the foundation upon which [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] rests. If any of us falter, the realm quakes.

EVTDESCBHF23761;All these days of mock-battles and constant drilling have finally paid off.

EVTDESCDHF23761;After countless nights spent awake in my study, reviewing reports and reordering the realm's archives and treasury, I have achieved a much greater understanding of the cogs that make this realm turn than I ever thought possible. With these new skills, I will surely be able to lead [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] into a new era of wealth and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23761;I have spent the last few nights extending my network of contacts and spies, hiring a veteran of the craft to teach me a few new tricks, and trying some of my own. As unpleasant as it was to take part in these dark proceedings, by refining my understanding of the human mind to a new level I will certainly be able to maintain peace throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFHF23761;I have lost track of how many books I have studied during the past few weeks. As of recently, I have been taken by a new craving for knowledge that I thought I had long satiated, and through it, I have acquired a much greater understanding of the world around us than I ever thought possible. These ancient wisdoms will surely help me in my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] has taken a deep interest in helping me deepen my understanding of politics and foreign as of recently. I was skeptical at first, but, after countless hours spent reviewing old treaties and mingling with [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s friends, I was amazed by how much I was able to learn in such a short amount of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] has spent a few weeks tutoring me on matters of war, hoping to share [From.GetHerHis] extensive tactical knowledge with me. [From.GetTitledFirstName] helped me learn how to drill my troops better and how to engage in complex mock-skirmishes to refine both the soldiers' and my own readiness. I could not believe that there was still so much to learn about strategy...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] has insisted that I spend some time with [From.GetHerHim], learning how to better defend myself. We trained and dueled for days, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the level of skill shown by my opponent. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was an exquisite training partner and a wonderful mentor. I am marveled at how much I have learned about combat in such a short time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] is of the opinion that I need to learn more about the responsibilities of a [Root.GetTitle]. [From.GetTitledFirstName] helped me to better understand some of the most commonly avoided duties associated with reviewing reports and administrating justice in the realm. Thanks to [From.GetHerHis] generous help, I have become a much more responsible ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMHF23761;At first I was skeptical of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s honesty when [From.GetSheHe] offered me [From.GetHerHis] help to extend my spy network and refine the less flattering skills that I employ to enforce my rule over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. And yet, after a few weeks of intriguing discoveries, I must admit that my [GetFromRelation]'s help was not only appreciated but sorely needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNHF23761;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been so courteous as to share some of [From.GetHerHis] most prized books and scarce time to help me refine my research method. I was amazed by the level of accuracy and care with which my [GetFromRelation] handled our collective studying sessions, and I have undoubtedly learned a lot by watching [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23761;I have still so much to learn...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23762;Dynastic names, family ties, political agreements, proper court manners... I hastily excuse myself from my council, my mind feverishly tormented by all the new information I am trying to assimilate. I really wished to learn more about ruling a realm, but all these rules and social cues are simply too intricate, too contradicting, too many!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23762;I feel my temples pulsating under my fingertips as I sit down in the middle of the training grounds, holding my head and searching for a slice of peace after another day wasted yelling at my troops in a fruitless attempt to test a new tactic. I am trying my hardest to become a better commander, yet the results of all my work have been minimal and disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23762;I let out a loud swear and order my training partner to stop, faltering for a few steps before finally finding my balance again. The soldier asks if we should resume our training, but I simply dismiss him with a grunt while rubbing my sore wrist. I have been trying my best to refine my dueling skills in the past few days, yet I am still unsatisfied with the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF23762;I angrily crumple another paper and throw it away from me, looking sourly in the opposite direction. I have tried my best to improve my skills as a steward to rule more fairly  and competently over the good people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], yet all my efforts seem to result into nothing concrete. Whoever made our laws so needlessly complicated?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23762;I dismiss the spy with an annoyed tap of my hand, returning to the solitude of my study. For a while I really thought I was making some progress, strengthening my network of spies and increasing my influence over [Root.Capital.GetName], yet mine was nothing but a fool's hope. At least half of my spies are turncoats working for my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFHF23762;The sudden slam of my head against the open book brutally brings me back to my senses. I look around in the library, with a mix of confusion and embarrassment, hoping that nobody noticed me falling asleep over my work again. I have wasted entire nights trying to refine my scholarly skills, yet I feel no wiser than I was last month.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHF23762;Dynastic names, family ties, political agreements, proper court manners... I hastily excuse myself from [From.GetTitledFirstName], my mind feverishly tormented by all the new information I am trying to assimilate. My [GetFromRelation]'s attempt to try and refine my diplomatic skills was well-intentioned, but it only made me more confused and upset about my limitations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHF23762;I feel my temples pulsating under my fingertips as I sit down in the middle of the training grounds, holding my head and searching for a slice of peace after another day wasted yelling at my troops. At first, I was excited when [From.GetTitledFirstName] offered me [From.GetHerHis] help to become a better commander, yet I simply cannot keep up with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHF23762;I let out a loud swear and ask [From.GetTitledFirstName] to stop, faltering for a few steps before finally finding my balance again. My [GetFromRelation] invites me to resume our training, but I simply shake my head. [From.GetHerHisCap] attempt to turn me into a better fighter by an intensive training was not as fruitful as either of us hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLHF23762;I angrily crumple another paper and throw it away from me, trying to avoid [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s gaze. My [GetFromRelation] has been trying to teach me how to better organize and rule over my lands, but I have barely been able to follow half of the concepts [From.GetSheHe] keeps saddling my mind with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMHF23762;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been trying to help me refine my skills and extend my spy network for a few days now, hoping that doing so would help me better rule over [Root.Capital.GetName].

EVTDESCNHF23762;The sudden slam of my head against the open book brutally brings me back to my senses. I look around in the library, with a mix of confusion and embarrassment, and meet the disappointed gaze of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. My [GetFromRelation] was hoping to help refine my research method, but, unfortunately, I have proven to not be a student worthy of [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23762;This is simply too much for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF23763;Ever since I started helping [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetFirstName] has not quite been the same. Drawn by a newly-awakened desire for knowledge, [From.GetSheHe] has increasingly neglected [From.GetHerHis] appearance. The more vacuous elements of the court have started maligning [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] stench and slobby demeanor, yet [From.GetSheHe] has found a steadfast supporter in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23763;My efforts to improve [From.GetFirstName]'s skills seems to have come at the unexpected price of my [GetFromRelation]'s looks. While less enlightened members of the court might berate [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] lack of care, I cannot deny the sight of [From.GetHerHis] oily, tangled hair and furrowed brow has a familiar, scruffy charm to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23763;You don't really smell that bad at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23764;Ever since I had to abandon some of my more frivolous habits in order to focus on my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], I have noticed that several courtiers have begun to avoid me. Most turn their nose up at my unwashed hair and worn-out clothes, yet I have found a kindred spirit in [scoped_kindred.GetTitledFirstName]. [scoped_kindred.GetSheHeCap] truly understands me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23764;Ever since I had to abandon some of my more frivolous habits in order to focus on my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], my tangled hair and foul stench have been the topic of many slanderous chats going on at court behind my back. Luckily for me, [scoped_kindred.GetTitledFirstName] has risen to my defense on many occasions in support of my new lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23764;People can be so petty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23765;I glimpse at [From.GetFirstName] from my place at the table, looking as my [GetFromRelation] hoards as much food as [From.GetSheHe] can on [From.GetHerHis] plate before hastily excuses [From.GetHerselfHimself] to return to [From.GetHerHis] study. A more frivolous person than I might judge [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] recent changes, but I understand all too well the burdens of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23765;Still chewing on a tart, [From.GetFirstName] complains about how most people at court simply do not understand the costs of commitment to one's duty. [From.GetSheHeCap] then licks [From.GetHerHis] fingers clean and gives a bashful glance to the paunch straining [From.GetHerHis] dress, but I quickly reassure [From.GetHerHim] that I understand perfectly how [From.GetSheHe] feels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23765;You have nothing to be ashamed of!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23766;Noting my sour expression as the weaver tightens the string around my gut in order to measure my size for a new clothes I have ordered, [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName] hastily assures me that it is perfectly understandable, and laudable even, for a [Root.GetTitle] to focus on [Root.GetHerHis] duties to the realm, even when it comes at the expense of private concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23766;I let out an annoyed grunt as the maid pushes harder against my back to tighten the laces of my dress, squeezing in my belly and thighs. "It is just a matter of sucking it in at the right moment," assures me [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName] while cleaning the jam of [scoped_kindred.GetHerHis] last tart from [scoped_kindred.GetHerHis] fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23766_A;Thank you, [From.GetFirstName], you are very kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF23767;[From.GetTitledFirstName] absentmindedly orders the servant to carry away the half-finished meal on [From.GetHerHis] desk, too enthralled by our conversation to finish eating. All these late nights and skipped meals have given [From.GetHerHim] the lanky appearance of a [From.GetManWoman] that is truly devoted to [From.GetHerHis] work, and I could not be happier for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23767;I have received some complaints by a few of [From.GetFirstName]'s friends. They claim that, because of my influence, my [GetFromRelation] is wasting away, so overwhelmed by [From.GetHerHis] new responsibilities that [From.GetSheHe] barely has time left to eat. Yet, personally, I see [From.GetHerHis] new lean look as a prized badge of [From.GetHerHis] unwavering dedication.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23767;Eating can be such a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23768;The effects of my newfound dedication to my duties as [Root.GetTitle] has not passed unnoticed at court. Many seem to be concerned about my new slender look and pale complexion, yet I have had a steadfast supporter in [scoped_kindred.GetTitledFirstName]. [scoped_kindred.GetSheHeCap] truly understands and appreciates the value of my sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23768;As [scoped_kindred.GetSheHe] passes me the next scroll, [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName] offhandedly comments that it is no wonder I am getting so much work done now that half of the men at court have stopped bothering me, mistaking me for a twiggy young boy. "Now, if only the priests would also leave me alone," I reply coyly, prompting us both to chuckle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF23768;I do not know what I would do without you, [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23769;Perhaps I was too harsh on my [GetFromRelation] when trying to tutor [From.GetHerHim]. I have put too much pressure on [From.GetFirstName] and obtained the opposite result of what I was hoping. Overwhelmed by all [From.GetHerHis] new responsibilities, [From.GetSheHe] has become an unfocused, broken mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP24007;Fine! Whatever you say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP24008;It took me some time to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of [scoped_potential_count.GetFirstName]'s clear potential, but I was able to get my way in the end. I am certain my [GetFromRelation] will not have reason to regret [From.GetHerHis] decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP24008;It took me some time to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] that I am still perfectly capable of administering more land and that granting me a new title would be merely in the interest of a prosperous [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], but I was able to get my way in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24008;The words of a wise [Root.GetManWoman] are hard to dismiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP24009;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to ignore my words. I cannot believe that [From.GetSheHe] would so easily dismiss the council of one of the elders of [From.GetHerHis] realm. Such a shortsightedness should never be tolerated in leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24009;What a foolish and impertinent child!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24010;It is quite clear that [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] is too inexperienced and foolish to handle all [scoped_ruler.GetHerHis] responsibilities as [scoped_ruler.GetTitle].

EVTDESCAHFP24013;It was too much of me to expect that [From.GetFirstName] would listen to reason now after ignoring my council for so long. The stubborn [From.GetTitle] has rebuked my suggestion again and again, too shortsighted and proud to admit the merit of my argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP24017;It has been a few weeks now since [From.GetTitledFirstName] started to claim I would make a wonderful [Root.GetTitle] for [scoped_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName].

EVTDESCHFP24018;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been going around [Root.Capital.GetName] praising [From.GetFirstName], claiming that [From.GetSheHe] would make a much better [Root.GetTitle] than I do. Perhaps I should have not treated the Elder so poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HF_49113;The Teutonic Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49113;After repeated tries to pacify the north, the Teutonic Knights have finally given up. At every turn, the pagans of the north have come together to protect their way of life.\n\nAs the Teutonic Knights finally renounced their Crusade against the pagans, the other Christians in the north will surely have a harder task at hand. With their opponents leaving, the pagans look to the south for potential new expansion.\n\nThe rest of the world awaits the pagan fury. The unquelled rampage of the north will surely come soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49113;What did the Teutons do!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49113;Another failure from the [From.Religion.GetName]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HF_49220;The Outstanding General;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49220;After leading troops on both sides of the wars raging throughout the Iberian Peninsula, I seem to have grown quite the reputation among the local peasants and soldiers on both sides.\n\nThough some would consider me a mercenary or a traitor to the faith, my prowess in war has made me a hero among most, and revered among the populace. Some would even go as far as to call me a folk hero.\n\nSurely, my actions must have been righteous, seeing all the responses. I have often wondered if it would all be worth it in the end, and it is a joyous occasion to see all my hard work has paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49220;I will be remembered throughout the ages.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49221;The Iberian Hero;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49221;I have fought for the faith several times these recent years, to recapture the Iberian Peninsula  as a true vanguard for Christendom and its followers.\n\nThough we were occupied by the Moors of Al-Andalus invading from the south who forced their way into the heartlands of Christianity, we have pushed them out of our home. Step by step, we have regained what is rightfully ours.\n\nHispania will rise as a bastion of Christianity once more. We will make sure of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49221;Forward, brethren!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49230;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI have heard about your struggles against the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s, and I would like to assure you I do not share their animosity towards the [Root.Religion.GetName]s.

EVTOPTA_HF_49235;It seems I have to look elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49241;There will probably be men showing up to fight for the faith in the upcoming wars for Iberia, but I could invest some money into spreading the message far and wide to attract more well trained troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49241;A small sum should be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49241;We need to make sure everyone hears about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49241;Take everything I have!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HF_49241;Sadly, I cannot afford it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49242;The wars for Iberia are costly, and it has made a noticeable dent into my finances. [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] has been a valiant supporter of our struggles for a long time, maybe it is time to ask [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] for help?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49242;A small donation is all I ask for.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49242;I expect a proper donation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_49243;A massive creature of a [new_commander.GetManWoman] is brought in front of me, supposedly [new_commander.GetSheHe] has quite the renown as a commander.

EVTOPTA_HF_49243;I am sure you will fit right in!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49243;I got just the job for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49243;Actually, I think we do not need another commander.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49244;A captain of a small fleet of ships appears at my court, trying to sell his services in the upcoming wars. Some of my commanders question the need for ships, but surely I could find a use for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49244;I will happily take you up on the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49244;You would not happen to know more captains, would you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49244;We do not need ships to fight at land!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49249;A year has passed since I started my preparations for the reconquest of Iberia, and I am sure that whoever wanted to take part in the reconquest would have arrived by now. Now all that remains is to find a place to point my newfound allies towards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49249;Now to find a fitting target.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49450;The Iberian Reconquest;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49450;As the last in a long line of attempts to try to reconquer the Iberian Peninsula, [From.GetTitledName] has begun preparing [From.GetHerHis] troops and looking for allies for a new Iberian campaign. Trying to restore parts of the peninsula to Christendom, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has spent a noticeable amount of resources and sent out a call to gather troops from all around the region.\n\nWith the Christians planning for war, the other faiths have started assembling their troops to defend themselves. It is only a matter of months, or maybe a year, before the two sides will clash together once more, desperately trying to claw their way to more land in Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49450;Iberia belongs to Christianity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49450;The Christian rabble does not belong here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49451;Rise of Hispania;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49451;With the rise of the [e_spain.GetFullName], the Iberian Peninsula has come under total control of the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s. There was a long struggle between the different faiths occupying the peninsula, but the [From.Religion.GetGroupName] believers has finally conquered their adversaries.\n\nWith the struggle of the two sides finally put to rest, Iberia can finally start looking forward to a peaceful future, free of the wars that has raged through the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49451;Hispania will be a cornerstone of our faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49451;Cursed infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HF_49452;End of the Reconquest;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49452;Not even the Balearic Islands have been safe from the Christian reconquest of Iberia. The final bastions of the other faiths in the region has fallen, now there is only Christendom left.\n\nWith Iberia finally restored to the faithful, the reconquest of the peninsula has ended, and peace has been restored. Once more a cornerstone of the faith, Iberia will surely play an important role in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49452;As it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49462;A minor noble has launched a campaign to start gathering troops to reconquer parts of Iberia. [From.GetTitledFirstName] asks for my help in supporting [From.GetHerHim], and taking part in the reconquest. This is a great opportunity to push back the infidels from Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49462;It would be my honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49462;Help a minor noble? I think not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49463;As the sponsor of the upcoming reconquest campaign, I have a prime opportunity to aid [FromFrom.GetDynName]. But in what manner will I help [FromFrom.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49463;I will use my renown to find [FromFrom.GetHerHim] a lot of troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49463;My connections with the clergy will prove invaluable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49463;Wealth can topple any enemy and bless any ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_42209;As I walk through the streets of [current_location.GetName], I suddenly feel someone bump into me, as a boy runs down the street. With a pouch that looks surprisingly like mine in his hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42209;No matter, there was not a lot of money left in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42209;Let us find that kid and make him pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42209;Maybe he could be of use to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42210;After hearing about a wise man in the local area, I decide to go visit him and see what he has to offer. He starts talking about ephemeral concepts that sounds like blasphemy, but I tell my men to go outside so I can hear what he has to offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42210;I will learn what he has to offer, blasphemy or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42210;Blasphemers must die. I will see what the rest of his library has to offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_42211;Let us take part in the festivities!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42211;It is not befitting of a true [Root.Religion.GetGroupName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42211;Maybe these harvest festivals are to the real gods?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42212;I wake up to the voice of what I am sure to be [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] after a late night with my men. It only lasted for a second, but I am sure I was told to use all my resources to continue our righteous Crusade and help my allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42212;It must be so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42212;Maybe I should not have had that much to drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_42215;I have noticed that my men seem somewhat restless these last days. Our stay in [current_location.GetName] has taken its toll on them, and they seem a bit demotivated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42215;I will drill the men back into a fighting force!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42215;They just need some inspiration!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42215;I make them unstoppable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42220;Maybe the [current_location.Religion.GetName] faith has more to offer us?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[other_combatant.GetSheHe] asks, sounding genuinely curious. "[GetClaimDuelDemand]", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] finally pleads.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10106_B;[From.GetBestName] refused to see reason. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] flung [From.GetHerHis] weapon back and forth, flailing wildly, still no closer to actually injuring me – all the while shouting that [From.GetSheHe] would never kneel to me.

EVTDESC_HF_14001_bravery;I have seen [student.GetBestName] during a couple of gatherings with [Root.Society.GetName], and I cannot help but notice how the [student.GetAgeAdjective] [student.GetManWoman] appears needlessly jumpy. Flinching at jokes, turning down sparring matches... "[student.GetSheHeCap] needs guidance", I find myself muttering.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_ambition;Upon returning from a small raid with my personal guard, I have been talking to [student.GetBestName]. The [student.GetManWoman] does not understand the urge for adventure, whatsoever. "What about the prosperity it brings your tribe?", I argue, showing off a new bracelet decorating my arm. [student.GetSheHeCap] sighs, seemingly unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_patience;Observing yet another game of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType], and [student.GetTitledFirstName] storming off with a sullen expression on [student.GetHerHis] face, it occurs to me how my [student.GetRootRelation] sorely lacks patience. "It is useful in battle as well", I mumble, scratching my chin, contemplating offering [student.GetHerHim] some guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_diligence;Watching [student.GetBestName] in the training grounds is always interesting. There is something about [student.GetHerHis] fighting technique that comes off as half-hearted, and [student.GetHerHis] weapons, as well as armor, seem like they could use a little more caring for... "[student.GetFirstName], could I have a word?", I interrupt the sparring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_bravery;As a warrior, [student.GetSheHe] needs me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_ambition;Oh, I could help you hone that ambition, [student.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_14002_bravery;"I hear you are turning down duels", a [teacher.GetManWoman] sounds behind me. Spinning around, I find myself talking to my [teacher.GetRootRelation], [teacher.GetTitledFirstName]. "[Root.Society.GetNameCap] are aware, of course", [teacher.GetSheHe] says. Putting an arm over my shoulder, [teacher.GetSheHe] continues: "I could help you! You just need a little guidance, my good [Root.GetManWoman]!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_ambition;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from a raid in foreign lands. My [teacher.GetRootRelation] is showing off the bounty brought back, when I let out a sigh, causing [teacher.GetHerHim] to pause. "You know, you always seem so content with what you have, [Root.GetFirstName]" [teacher.GetSheHe] says. "I could help you hone your ambition", [teacher.GetSheHe] presses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_patience;I recently lost a game of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType], and [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has approached me, wanting to talk about my temper. "Patience is something that comes from within", my [teacher.GetRootRelation] explains. I clench my fist, a gesture not lost on the [teacher.GetManWoman]. "You just need some guidance", [teacher.GetSheHe] finally says.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_diligence;[teacher.GetBestName] is watching me in the training grounds.

EVTOPTB_HF_14003_TT;You will simply be yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14004_A;[student.GetTitledFirstName] politely declined my offer. The [student.GetManWoman] apparently feels perfectly fine with the current state of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14004_B;[student.GetTitledFirstName] refused my offer, muttering something about not being a charity project. If adequacy is enough for the [student.GetManWoman], who am I to intervene?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14004;That ungrateful...! I was going to bring my favorite [Root.GetTeachingMomentTool]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14004;I'll leave [student.GetHerHim] alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14005;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate my response and has sworn to never aid me in any way, ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14005;Some people are rather sensitive, are they not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_bravery;When [teacher.GetBestName] informed me that we were going to live in the woods for a few nights, I was tempted to refuse. We could be eaten by snakes! By [Root.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal]s! Or attacked by raiders! However, falling asleep in the wilderness, to the wind and rustling of the trees, my fears began to wane. Now, I do not know what it was that I was so afraid of.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_ambition;When [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] said we were going to spend several days in a library, my heart sank. "The scribes know details about all the famous warriors" [teacher.GetSheHe] beamed. Thankfully, it only takes a few hours before I find myself enthralled by the stories. "I knew you had it in you", [teacher.GetSheHe] says cheerfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_patience;I was not excited to watch others play games of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType], and I think [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] could tell. Yet, the patience with which my [teacher.GetRootRelation] narrated the matches to me, explaining each subtle move, was eye-opening. Even seeing fighters who lost one day, return for revenge the next, was inspiring!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_diligence;When my [teacher.GetRootRelation] suggested we spend a few afternoons reorganizing [teacher.GetHerHis] armory, I expected to be bored within moments. Yet [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to keep my interest for several days, and I find myself asking questions I have never even thought of before. I am almost embarrassed by my former attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14006;Thank you, friend, for this opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14006;I cannot express how grateful I am. Can I... Can I kiss you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_14007_bravery;I would not have chosen "camping in the woods", but perhaps that is the point. When my [teacher.GetRootRelation] informed me that we were going to live in the wilderness for a few nights, I pushed all imagery of falling off cliffs and being eaten by snakes aside. Looking back on the experience, I have to admit, I am sad it is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_ambition;"You want us to spend time, voluntarily, in the library?" [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] nods. "Yes! I think you'll enjoy hearing about old heroes," [teacher.GetSheHe] laughs, [teacher.GetHerHis] eyes aglitter. A few hours later, I understand. The tales are fascinating! "Some make for decent role models", I admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_patience;"We are going to watch *others* play at [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType]?" [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] dismissed my reluctance, and gestured me to a seat. Soon, [teacher.GetSheHe] was narrating the games to me, pointing out subtleties and things I would usually miss. "I.. am beginning to understand how a hot temper might get in the way of these things..." I admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_diligence;"Surely, your armory must already be in order?" I offer, but [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] shakes [teacher.GetHerHis] head. "This is more about mastering the principles behind the organizing, than the organizing itself" the [teacher.GetManWoman] explains. A few days later, I admit, I have learned some valuable techniques and practices...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_bravery;There is nothing to fear here, is there?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_ambition;Perhaps I simply never knew of all the things I *could* achieve?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_patience;I will exercise patience next time, [teacher.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_diligence;I will strive to be more diligent in the future, [teacher.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_bravery;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] had us go into the woods, where we were supposed to spend several nights. "Living off the land!" [teacher.GetSheHe] said. "I am the [Root.GetTitle]! I live comfortably in my [Root.GetCapitalHolding], thank you", I responded. The next couple of days were a frightening drudge of unsettling rustling in the trees, cold, and food poisoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_ambition;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] and I spent several days couped up in a dusty old library. Apparently it was supposed to "inspire" me, whatever that means. I am sorry to say it had the opposite effect. "Perhaps we are not that alike, after all", the [teacher.GetManWoman] sighs in disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_patience;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] forced me to sit and watch all our friends playing games of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType]. And throughout the whole experience, the [teacher.GetManWoman] talked, and talked, trying to explain the game to me. Eventually I had enough and walked out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_diligence;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] put me to cleaning [teacher.GetHerHis] armory. And everything I did was wrong...! The [teacher.GetManWoman] kept giving me counter-effective instructions and muttering under [teacher.GetHerHis] breath about "impossible", and "why do I even try". If there was a lesson in this, I do not think I understood it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14008;I don't know why I don't learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

For some reason the person who shows up on the other sides of the bars is a [crossfire_target.GetManWoman], saying "I heard we had a real brute down here. I got curious." I lash out at [crossfire_target.GetHerHis] smirk, punching the iron bar so hard my fingers crunch. My blood boils, but all I can do is crumple to the floor, the pain overwhelming my blood thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10070_B;I can't stand being confined here. In the corner of our cell, [crossfire_target.GetFirstName] stands, scratching something in the wall. "Doesn't it drive you mad?!" I growl at [crossfire_target.GetHerHim]. "YOU drive me mad!" [crossfire_target.GetSheHe] roars, flying for my throat. My boiling blood takes hold of me and soon the [crossfire_target.GetManWoman] is lying whimpering on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10103_intrigue_A_attacker;My [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] seems unaware that the little scrape I inflicted is what is causing [other_combatant.GetHerHis] limbs to slowly go numb... "Valiant effort!" I proclaim, watching [other_combatant.GetHerHis] sluggish movements. When [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lunges at me, I carefully step aside, letting [other_combatant.GetHerHis] subsequent collapse look like a failed attack.

EVTDESC_HF_10103_intrigue_A_defender_self;"Impressive!" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] splutters, on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] knees in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc].

EVTDESC_HF_10104_intrigue_A_defender;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] has only managed to get a few scrapes in on me, yet I can feel my energy draining. Something is wrong. I wonder... [Root.GetPoisonSpeculation];;;;;;;;;;;;x

String_spymaster_averted_it;I am exhausted, I realize. In fact, breathing is hard, and my chest feels tight. "What is...", I mumble, as I fall to the ground, catching a glimpse of [other_combatant.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] in the crowd.

String_they_averted_it_themselves;\nSuddenly, the taste of blood fills my mouth. "YOU were going to poison ME?", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] hisses, throwing a second dagger into my chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10105_default_A;"It's a good day for a duel!", I chuckle, hefting my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] in my hand. "Enough talking", my opponent growls. Soon, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is lying face down in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc], as I have seen to [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10105_default_B;My opponent looks nervous, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] armor a little ill-fitting, and I briefly contemplate asking if [other_combatant.GetSheHe] would rather do this another day... A moment later, I snap out of it, letting the fresh morning air sharpen my senses instead. The [other_combatant.GetCharacterLook] [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is soon on the ground, groaning in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10105_default_C;The sun is beginning to set when I meet with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], my [GetDuelWeapon] ready. After [other_combatant.GetSheHe] [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly] dodges one attack, my next one lands perfectly. Frantically, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] attempts to cover [other_combatant.GetHerHis] injured [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], but I have rarely seen so much blood...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10106_default_A;"Don't look so glum", [other_combatant.GetTitledName] offers. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] has me on the ground, *again*, and I losing any patience I ever had. "You oaf-" I begin, but I collapse from the pain. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] has managed to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe], and the clear scent of blood has me dizzy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10106_default_B;I am not sure what is wrong with me, but nothing I do has any effect on [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. "Come on, don't give up already!" [other_combatant.GetSheHe] commands, disgruntlement clear in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] voice. I try to rise, but I can't. My [Root.GetBodyPartInjured] hurts like it never has before. "I am just going to rest a little, here in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc]", I mumble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10106_default_C;Pain is throbbing in my [GetBodyPartInjured], and I clench my jaw, trying not to cry. "It's not over!" I growl, but my opponent is lowering [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon. The last rays of the evening sun envelops [other_combatant.GetHerHim], and suddenly, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] looks like a warrior sent by the heavens themselves...! In an attempt to say something about it, I pass out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10109_B;My [GetBodyPartInjured] hurts, but it somehow doesn't seem as bad as what my opponent is suffering. "I'm not done!", [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] says, through gritted teeth, but then [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lies back down on the ground, throwing [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon] to the side. When I step closer [other_combatant.GetSheHe] splutters: "No no, I'm done! I yield!".;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10109_C;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is taken aback when I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow]. "[Root.GetTitledFirstName] wins!" someone proclaims, and my opponent groans. I am ignoring the pain in my [GetBodyPartInjured], but I have a suspicion [GetSeverityOfInjury].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10110_B;"No, I can still fight!" I say, dropping to my knees, sensing my own lie. Even though [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] has clearly injured [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], [other_combatant.GetSheHe] has been proclaimed the winner. Sighing, I ponder my own worst injury. I have a feeling [Root.GetSeverityOfInjury].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10110_C;"You don't give up, do you?" my opponent laughs. "I've thought about it", I mutter, attempting to stand. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] did just see to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe]... As I slump back on the ground, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] smiles in triumph.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_double_death_intrigue_poison_killed_them;"Die!" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] bellows, with what must be the last of [other_combatant.GetHerHis] strength. The blow to my [GetBodyPartInjured] comes with a blinding pain, but one last glance at my opponent, I feel certain that the exhausted [other_combatant.GetManWoman] will join me in my death...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_double_death_intrigue_poison_killed_me;It is with effort that I finally [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow]. But as it dawns on me that I am about to win the fight, instead of letting out a cry of victory, I struggle for breath. As I fall to the ground, I can't feel my legs. The last thing I see is the blue sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_double_death_intrigue_both_used_poison;There is something odd about the reluctance with which [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is fighting. Perhaps the poison I had my agents prepare is working better than anticipated? My [GetBodyPartInjured] is stinging with pain, and inspecting my other wounds, I find myself feeling dizzy, my vision beginning to blur... No... No, no, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving sluggishly. Perhaps it's due to the special breakfast I had my agents prepare for [other_combatant.GetHerHim], but it is clear that the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is not in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] best form. Before anyone catches on, I attack with full force. It feels almost too easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10104_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly], yet I can't even muster the strength to hold my [GetDuelWeapon] right. "You look tired, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] says, stepping closer. I want to protest, but my head is swimming. Smirking, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] swings [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon], and [Root.GetKillingBlowOnMeShort].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10105_intrigue_default;For a moment I am worried that [other_combatant.GetHerHis] armor is going to simply fall off [other_combatant.GetHerHim], but [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] does not appear to notice my sabotage. All I need to do is land a blow in the right area and... There! The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is spinning, clutching [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], screaming in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10106_intrigue_default;I instructed the squire to weaken my opponent's armor, but I am having trouble spotting the sabotage. "Are you making a wish?" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] asks, impatiently – we have been at this for hours, and my scheming has lead nowhere. I back away, clutching my [GetBodyPartInjured].

Surely there's a reason for this continued contact?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[witness1.GetTitledFirstName] is staring at me with such intensity one's skin could burn, and [witness1.GetSheHe] is not alone in witnessing my crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51003;No! It is not what you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51003;It was [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName]! [weapon_forger.GetSheHeCap] told me to do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51004;I succeeded in my plan to [GetDecidedActionInHF51002] to forge a soulbound weapon.

[weapon_forger.GetFirstName] struggles for words and then mutters that it is a bad omen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_51005;This is clearly your fault! Fix it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_51006;The day has finally come, the [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now complete. [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName] said [weapon_forger.GetSheHe] would bring the weapon to me first thing in the morning, but never showed. The intrusive thought of [weapon_forger.GetHerHim] stealing my [GetDecidedWeapon] enters my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_51007;The day has finally come, the [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now complete. As I arrive at the decided location of meeting with [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName], I hear [weapon_forger.GetHerHim] screaming bloody murder. [unfortunate_child.GetTitledFirstName] had somehow gotten a hold of the weapon and injured [unfortunate_child.GetHerselfHimself]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51007;This is a cursed weapon that thirsts for blood! Get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51007;The weapon is not what injured the child. The blame is on [unfortunate_child.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF20300_B;It is what it is...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESDHFD20305;The time of my coronation draws near: only a few more days before I am crowned [Root.GetTitle] before God and all my subjects. It will be a long wait and I can only hope that the day will not fall in the middle of a major battle...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20355;What sort of [Root.GetTitle] am I to become? I could not even manage to organize a proper coronation ceremony, during a time of peace. Here I am, wading through the mud of a military encampment, preparing to receive my crown in the most undignified of settings...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20356;However justified my reasons were to organize a secluded ceremony during a war, my vassals are far from pleased. Not only do they perceive it as a sign of weakness, but they all seem to have taken their lack of invitation as a personal slight against them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20357;I have only heard of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s pending coronation after the news spread across the realm. It seems that the [From.GetTitle] has organized a very secluded ceremony for [From.GetHerHis] coronation, to be held in [From.GetHerHis] own military tent. Invitation was granted only to [From.GetHerHis] most trusted councilors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20358;As if sending a Cardinal in [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] place was not enough of a slight from the Holy Father, the Papal envoy himself has proven to be a most insufferable man, constantly complaining about the lack of care he is receiving and recanting all the many dangers I am exposing him to by having this coronation held in the middle of a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20359;It came to me as no surprise that [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] was disappointed with the secluded ceremony my liege organized for [From.GetHerHis] coronation. The [coronation_priest.GetTitle] even refused to visit my ruler in person, claiming that it would have been too dangerous a travel for [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] to partake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFM20366;As the yells of the commanders drilling troops echo in the tent, [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] gives me a quick blessing and summarily places the crown upon my head, proclaiming me [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] of [coronation_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName] by grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFN20366;As the yells of the commanders drilling troops echo in the tent, [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName]'s envoy gives me a quick blessing and summarily places the crown upon my head, proclaiming me [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] of [coronation_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName] by grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_12200_X;As the [combatant_2.GetManWoman] unclasps [combatant_2.GetHerHis] cloak, I gasp. Beneath the disguise of a poor and withered elder, is an athletic and statuesque person, donned in fanciful armor. [combatant_2.GetSheHeCap] lashes out at me with a silvery sword, and I almost scream in surprise. When it is over, I am bloody and out of breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_Y;The crowd is cheering loudly as the giant looms over me. All the men I have fought so far pale in comparison. "YOU DIE NOW!" the beast of a [combatant_2.GetManWoman] roars, swinging a massive club. When it fails to hit me and bites the ground, the earth shakes.

EVTDESC_HF_12201_X;"I keep telling you plucky fools: I am retired", the [combatant_2.GetManWoman] hisses, unsheathing a silvery sword and straightening [combatant_2.GetHerHis] back. It dawns on me that my original assessment was wrong. "You're... Some kind of dueli-", I try, but I do not have time to finish my words. I am spluttering blood, staring in disbelief as my killer walks away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_Y;The giant only grunts in response to my taunts, sluggishly swinging [combatant_2.GetHerHis] massive club. I slash at [combatant_2.GetHerHis] legs and unprotected arms, and the crowd roars with excitement. Suddenly, my opponent discards [combatant_2.GetHerHis] weapon, declaring: "I'll stop toying with you now, barbarian". [combatant_2.GetHerHisCap] swings pick up speed. I have nowhere to run.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_Z;"A BEAR?" I protest. "Aye, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the spindly man nods, gesturing onto the stage. "Fight!", [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] proclaims, and I do.
